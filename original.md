### Prologue  

WHEN a nation's money is no longer a source of security, and when inflation has become the  
concern of an entire people, it is natural to turn for information and guidance to the history of  
other societies who have already undergone this most tragic and upsetting of human experiences.  
Yet to survey the great array of literature of all kinds — economic, military, social, historic,  
political, and biographical — which deals with the fortunes of the defeated Central Powers after  
the First World War is to discover one particular shortage. Either the economic analyses of the  
times (for reasons best known to economists who sometimes tend to think that inflations are  
deliberate acts of fiscal policy) have ignored the human element, to say nothing in the case of the  
Weimar Republic and of post-revolutionary Austria of the military and political elements; or the  
historical accounts, though of impressive erudition and insight, have overlooked — or at least  
much underestimated — inflation as one of the most powerful engines of the upheavals which  
they narrate.  

The first-hand accounts and diaries, on the other hand, although of incalculable value in  
assessing inflation from the human aspect, have tended even in anthological form either to have  
had too narrow a field of vision — the battle seen from one shell-hole may look very different  
when seen from another — or to recall the financial extravaganza of 1923 in such a general way  
as to underplay the many years of misfortune of which it was both the climax and the herald.  
The agony of inflation, however prolonged, is perhaps somewhat similar to acute pain — totally  
absorbing, demanding complete attention while it lasts; forgotten or ignorable when it has gone,  
whatever mental or physical scars it may leave behind. Some such explanation may apply to the  
strange way in which the remarkable episode of the Weimar inflation has been divorced — and  
vice versa — from so much contemporary incident. And yet, one would have thought,  
considering how persistent, extended and terrible that inflation was, and how baleful its  
consequences, no study of the period could be complete without continual reference to the one  
obsessive circumstance of the time.  

The converse is also true: except at the narrowest level of economic treatise or personal  
reminiscence, how can a fair account of the German inflation be given outside the context of  
political subversion by Nationalists and by Communists, or the turmoil in the Army, or the  
quarrel with France, or the problem of war reparations, or the parallel hyperinflations in Austria  
and Hungary? How can one gauge the political significance of inflation, or judge the  
circumstances in which inflation in an industrialised democracy takes root and becomes  
uncontrollable, unless its course is charted side by side with the political events of the moment?  
The Germany of 1923 was the Germany of Ludendorff as well as of Stinnes, of Havenstein as  
well as of Hitler. For all their different worlds, of the Army, of industry, of finance and of  
politics, these four grotesque figures stalking the German stage may equally be represented as  
the villains of the play: Ludendorff, the soulless, humourless, ex-Quartermaster-General,  
worshipper of Thor and Odin, rallying point and dupe of the forces of reaction; Stinnes, the  
plutocratic profiteer who owed allegiance only to Mammon; Havenstein, the mad banker whose  
one object was to swamp the country with banknotes; Hitler, the power-hungry demagogue  
whose every speech and action even then called forth all that was evil in human nature. In
respect of Havenstein alone the description is of course unjust; but the fact that this highly-  
respected financial authority was sound in mind made no difference to the wreckage he wrought.

Or one may say that there were no real human villains; that given the economic and political  
cues, actors would have been in the wings to come on and play the parts which circumstances  
dictated. Certainly there were many others as reprehensible and irresponsible as those who  
played the leading roles. The German people were the victims. The battle, as one who survived it  
explained, left them dazed and inflation-shocked. They did not understand how it had happened  
to them, and who the foe was who had defeated them.

This book presents a few new facts, but many forgotten facts and many hitherto unpublished  
opinions — most usefully of those who could observe events objectively because their purses,  
health and security were unaffected by what they were witnessing. The most bountiful store of  
such material are the records of the British Foreign Office, supplied originally by the embassy in  
Berlin where Lord D'Abernon prosecuted in those years one of the most successful  
ambassadorships of the age. His information was amply augmented by the consular service in  
every important city in Germany, as by reports from individual members of the Allied  
commissions concerned with reparations or disarmament. The documents in the Public Record  
Office, apart from being among the more accessible, are also probably the most important source  
available, not only because the British Embassy through D'Abernon was in exceptionally close  
touch at all times with Germany's senior politicians, but because the withdrawal of the United  
States presence at the start of 1933, and the almost complete interruption of any communication  
between Berlin and Paris earlier still, rendered sporadic or superficial what might have been  
information of comparable value. Supplemented by contemporary German material, I have not  
hesitated to draw as fully as seemed justified on those papers.

I have tried as far as possible to keep these actions, reactions and interactions in their proper  
historical sequence in the hope that this perhaps obvious order is in this case both a new and  
enlightening one, and the better to expose a number of important but little-noticed relationships.  
In relating the story, I have followed, and at times had to hang on grimly to a special thread  
which wound through Austria, Hungary, Russia, Poland and France, too. It is one which the great  
authorities have sometimes seemed to lose touch with: the effect of inflation on people as  
individuals and as nations, and how they responded to it.

I have not, however, dared to draw hard and fast conclusions about humanity and inflation on the  
basis of what I have written

here: the facts speak very well for themselves. Still less have I expounded any economic lessons  
or indulged in theoretical explanations of economic phenomena. This is emphatically not an  
economic study. Yet inflation is about money as well as people, and it would be impossible to  
tell the tale without introducing figures, sometimes vast figures, again and again. Vast figures  
were what the people of central Europe were assailed by and bludgeoned with for years on end  
until they could bear no more. The value of the mark in 1922 and 1923 was in everyone's mind;  
but who could comprehend a figure followed by a dozen ciphers?

In October 1923 it was noted in the British Embassy in Berlin that the number of marks to the  
pound equalled the number of yards to the sun. Dr Schacht, Germany's National Currency Commissioner, 
explained that at the end of the Great War one could in theory have bought  
500,000,000,000 eggs for the same price as that for which, five years later, only a single egg was  
procurable. When stability returned, the sum of paper marks needed to buy a gold mark was  
precisely equal to the quantity of square millimetres in a square kilometre. It is far from certain  
that such calculations helped anyone to understand what was going on; so let the un-  
mathematical reader take heart.  

Because of the varying ways in which nations express large amounts, I have tried to avoid  
notations such as billions and trillions upon which custom is confusingly divided. When I have  
departed from this practice, due indication has been given.  

It has been harder in the writing to find enough simple epithets to describe without repetition the  
continuous, worsening succession of misfortunes that struck the German people at this time. It  
was a difficulty noticed and noted by Mr Lloyd George writing in 1932, who said that words  
such as 'disaster', 'ruin', and 'catastrophe' had ceased to rouse any sense of genuine apprehension  
any more, into such common usage had they fallen. Disaster itself was devalued: in  
contemporary documents the word was used year after year to describe situations incalculably  
more serious than the time before. When the mark finally dropped out of sight and ruin was all  
around, there were still Germans to be heard predicting Katastrophe for the future.  

I have tried, therefore, to limit the number of disasters, crashes, cataclysms, collapses and  
catastrophes in the text, as well as the degree of crisis and chaos, to a digestible amount, to which  
the reader may mentally add as much more as his power of sympathy dictates.  
In one other matter the reader must act independently. It has been necessary frequently to give  
the 1920s' sterling or dollar equivalents of the mark sums involved, in order to show the degree  
of the mark's depreciation. The continuing process of inflation of all western countries makes  
conversion to present-day value an unrewarding occupation. For the lowest range of conversions  
have kept to the £sd system of 12 pence to the shilling am shillings to the pound. At this  
distance, cost of living comparisons are fairly futile; yet it may be useful to reckon that in the  
middle of 1975 it was necessary to multiply every 1920 sterling figure by almost 15 times to find  
an equivalent. Thus a wage of £200 in 1919 may be worth £3,000 today; a sum of ten shillings  
worth seven or eight pounds. For dollars, a multiplicator of six or eight could be enough. If a  
mark in 1913 would buy almost a pound's worth of goods services in 1975 (some items, clearly,  
were much more expensive than others such as labour much cheaper in real terms than now) No  
simple but rough conversion is available for sterling readers whom it amuses or vexes to imagine  
paying £148,000,000 for a postage stamp: for marks they should read pounds.  
There is no constant rule of thumb for coping accurately witt later stages of the inflation. Until  
autumn 1921 the internal depreciation of the mark sometimes lagged far behind its fall abroad;  
making Germany such a haven for tourists. Later on (from beginning of 1922), as public  
confidence in the mark dissolved, domestic prices adjusted themselves rapidly upwards in tune to  
the dollar rate, and at the end were even heftily anticipating mark's fall. This was one more of the  
phenomena of the times which fatally confused the issue then and which exercised the interest of  
economists for many years afterwards.

This is, I believe, a moral tale. It goes far to prove the revolutionary axiom that if you wish to  
destroy a nation you must corrupt its currency. Thus must sound money be the first bastion of a  
society's defence.

### 1: Gold for Iron

JUST BEFORE THE First World War in 1913, the German mark, the British shilling, the French  
franc, and the Italian lira were all worth about the same, and four or five of any were worth about  
a dollar. At the end of 1923, it would have been possible to exchange a shilling, a franc or a lira  
for up to 1,000,000,000,000 marks, although in practice by then no one was willing to take  
marks in return for anything. The mark was dead, one million-millionth of its former self. It had  
taken almost ten years to die.

The mark's fall began gradually. In the war years, 1914-1918, its foreign exchange value halved,  
and by August 1919 it had halved again. In early 1920, however, although the cost of living had  
risen less than nine times since 1914, the mark had only one-fortieth of its overseas purchasing  
power left. There followed twelve months of nervous fluctuation, but then the mark sped  
downwards with gathering momentum, dragging social misery and political disruption in its  
wake. Not until 1923 did Germany's currency at last go over the cliff-edge of sanity to which it  
had, as it were, clung for many months with slipping finger-tips. Pursuing the money of Austria  
and Hungary into the abyss, it crashed there more heavily than either.

The year 1923 was the one of galloping inflation when a kind of madness gripped Germany's  
financial authorities and economic disaster overwhelmed millions of people. It was the year of  
astronomical figures, of 'wheelbarrow inflation', of financial phenomena that had never been  
observed before. The death of the mark in November 1923 came as a merciful release, for the  
events of the preceding eight months had ensured that the old mark could never recover. They  
ensured, too, that Germany would have to undergo appalling rigours of financial reconstruction  
such as might otherwise have been escaped. The re-establishment of monetary sanity, which  
bankrupted thousands, robbed millions of their livelihoods, and killed the hopes of millions  
more, indirectly exacted a more terrible price which the whole world had to pay.

The inflation of 1923 was so preposterous, and its end so sudden, that the story has tended to be  
passed off more as a historical curiosity, which it also undoubtedly was, than as the culmination  
of a chain of economic, social and political circumstance of permanent significance. It matters  
little that the causes of the Weimar inflation are in many ways unrepeatable; that political  
conditions are different, or that it is almost inconceivable that financial chaos would ever again  
be allowed to develop so far. The question to be asked — the danger to be recognised — is how  
inflation, however caused, affects a nation: its government, its people, its officials, and its  
society. The more materialist that society, possibly, the more cruelly it hurts. If what happened to  
the defeated Central Powers in the early 19203 is anything to go by, then the process of collapse  
of the recognised, traditional, trusted medium of exchange, the currency by which all values are  
measured, by which social status is guaranteed, upon which security depends, and in which the  
fruits of labour are stored, unleashes such greed, violence, unhappiness, and hatred, largely bred  
from fear, as no society can survive uncrippled and unchanged.

Certainly, 1922 and 1923 brought catastrophe to the German, Austrian and Hungarian  
bourgeoisie, as well as hunger, disease, destitution and sometimes death to an even wider public.  
Yet any people might have ridden out those years had they represented one frightful storm in an  
otherwise calm passage. What most severely damaged the morale of those nations was that they

were merely the climax of unreality to years of unimagined strain of every kind. Financially, for  
nearly four years, the ultimate cataclysm was always just round the corner. It always arrived, and  
there was always an even worse one on its way — again, and again, and again. The speeches, the  
newspaper articles, the official records, the diplomatic telegrams, the letters and diaries of the  
period, all report month by month, year by year, that things could not go on like that any longer:  
and yet things always did, from bad to worse, to worse, to worse. It was unimaginable in 1921  
that 1922 could hold any more terrors. They came, sure enough, and were in due course eclipsed,  
and more than eclipsed, with the turn of the following year.

To ascribe the despair which gripped those nations entirely to inflation would of course be  
misleading. In the winter of 1918-1919 all three underwent political revolutions, following the  
deprivations of wartime and crushing military defeat: so that conditions were fundamentally  
unfavourable to any revival of national spirit not rooted in revenge, and would have remained so  
even had the peace treaties permitted the losers to struggle however gradually to their economic  
feet. It is not always clear what events — what popular uprising, or Allied ultimatum, or political  
assassination — contributed to the inflationary panic; or which were themselves directly or  
indirectly caused by the ceaseless depreciation of the currency and rise in the cost of living.

Undoubtedly, though, inflation aggravated every evil, ruined every chance of national revival or  
individual success, and eventually produced precisely the conditions in which extremists of  
Right and Left could raise the mob against the State, set class against class, race against race,  
family against family, husband against wife, trade against trade, town against country. It  
undermined national resolution when simple want or need might have bolstered it. Partly because  
of its unfairly discriminatory nature, it brought out the worst in everybody — industrialist and  
worker, farmer and peasant, banker and shopkeeper, politician and civil servant, housewife,  
soldier, merchant, tradesman, miner, moneylender, pensioner, doctor, trade union leader, student,  
tourist -especially the tourist. It caused fear and insecurity among those who had already known  
too much of both. It fostered xenophobia. It promoted contempt for government and the  
subversion of law and order. It corrupted even where corruption had been unknown, and too  
often where it should have been impossible. It was the worst possible prelude — although  
detached from it by several years — to the great depression; and thus to what followed.

That is to put the inflation of early 1920s back again in its historical setting. From there, very  
probably, it is unwise to try too hard to prise it. After all, no one would argue strongly that the  
German inflation directly caused the world depression, nor even that it alone spawned Nazi  
Germany. Unquestionably it made the one the more unbearable and, as a contributary cause,  
made much easier the coming of the other. However, it is the purpose in the pages which follow  
not to predict by analogy a similar destiny for any industrialised, democratic nation in the grip of  
severe inflation, but rather, by recounting an extraordinary story, to present some of the evidence  
of what inflation may do to people, and what in consequence they may do to one another.

The origins of the German inflation are in some ways fundamental, in some ways incidental, to  
this theme. They xvere both internal and external. Even during the war, Germany's financial  
arrangements were such as to permit the grossest monetary excesses by her national banking  
system. They were eventually to render post-war inflation uncontrollable, while the nature and  
presentation of the Entente's reparation demands — the indemnity for the war — encouraged the  
activities of the printing presses to the utter exclusion of other, more desirable policies. Nor may

it be overlooked that Germany's industrialists ruthlessly drove their Government down the road  
to monetary doom.

Nevertheless, it was the natural reaction of most Germans, or Austrians, or Hungarians —  
indeed, as for any victims of inflation — to assume not so much that their money was falling in  
value as that the goods which it bought were becoming more expensive in absolute terms; not  
that their currency was depreciating, but -especially in the beginning — that other currencies  
were unfairly rising, so pushing up the price of every necessity of life. It reflected the point of  
view of those who believe the sun, the planets and the stars revolve with the moon around the  
earth.

In a lengthy interview many years afterwards with Pearl Buck, Erna von Pustau, whose father  
was a small Hamburg businessman who ran a fishmarket, made the same point: 'We used to say  
"The dollar is going up again", while in reality the dollar remained stable but our mark was  
falling. But, you see, we could hardly say our mark was falling since in figures it was constantly  
going up -and so were the prices — and this was much more visible than the realisation that the  
value of our money was going down ... It all seemed just madness, and it made the people mad.'  
In other words, the causes of the mark's depreciation, which certainly escaped Germany's  
politicians and bankers as well, had little enough to do with how the people, individually or  
collectively, reacted to it. Most of them clung to the mark, the currency they knew and believed  
in, long after the eleventh hour had come round for the umpteenth time. Most had no choice; but  
all were encouraged or bemused by the Reichsbank's creed of Mark gleich Mark — paper or  
gold, a mark is a mark is a mark. If prices went up, people demanded not a stable purchasing  
power for the marks they had, but more marks to buy what they needed. More marks were  
printed, and more, and more. Inflation, already in its fourth year when revolution overthrew the  
old regime, added a new, overwhelming uncertainty to the many uncertainties that attended the  
birth of the Weimar Republic.

Although the German revolution originated as a military mutiny against the bungling of the  
Army's leaders, and was bent upon getting rid of the officer caste who had brought military  
disaster upon the country, it had distinguishable economic origins as well. Support for the  
Soldiers' Councils which were coming into being in every unit as the war drew to an end rested  
heavily on the personal financial calamities which so many of the soldiers and their families  
were already experiencing. Their frustrations had been eloquently aggravated by the arrival at the  
front in the spring of 1918 of a group of seasoned anti-war agitators — the leaders of the factory  
strikes which had ravaged the country after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Communist Russia.  
The ruthlessly annexa-tionist terms of that treaty were but another of the crass political mistakes  
— including the unrestricted submarine warfare that brought the United States into the battle,  
and the return of Lenin to Petrograd — which were made by the Great German General Staff of  
whom the Kaiser liked to regard himself the war lord. Through the late summer of 1918  
defeatism and disaffection spread; and when defeat itself came the Army was torn in two,  
essentially between the professional soldiers and the conscripts.

The Supreme Command lost no time in exculpating itself in respect of losing the war. As the  
Kaiser fled to Holland, at least a week too late to save the monarchy in any form, and Ludendorff  
made off to Sweden, the odium of signing the Armistice was placed firmly on the head of the  
civilian authority. A month later, in December 1918, President Ebert at the Brandenburger Tor

was welcoming the legions home with the words: 'I salute you, who return unvanquished from  
the field of battle.'

The myth of the Dolchstoss, the stab in the back of the Army by the craven politicians and  
treacherous intellectuals behind the lines, was thereafter to be cultivated to the point when  
democratic political evolution was poisoned at its heart. This was a heavy burden for the new  
civilian government to bear, thrown unprepared and with an untried constitution into the deep  
end of democracy. Finding itself accepting the responsibility for a devastating defeat, and weak  
in human and material resources, it was miserably equipped to set to rights the financial and  
fiscal legacy of the purely and arrogantly militarist establishment which had run the war  
practically to the exclusion of politicians and economists.

Now the new Republic was saddled with the hatred of the Officer Corps as well, permanently  
generating Right-wing discontent and disruption during a period when Left-wing agitation in the  
wake of the Russian revolution was already as much as the government could cope with. The  
German revolution, as that in Austria, was a comparatively tame affair. True, as the Armistice  
commission completed its tasK, Berlin was in revolt, loyal troops going over hourly to the  
revolutionaries. True, too, that all twenty-two of Germany's lesser royalty had been deposed even  
before the Kaiser's formal abdication, Ludwig III of Bavaria hustling from the palace of the  
Wittelsbachs out into the fog and exile, with four daughters at his side and a box of cigars under  
his arm — a Soviet republic had already been declared in his patrimony. But the revolution had  
no other goals beyond the expulsion of the old order. There was neither barricade to man nor  
gun-fire to march towards.

The immediate turmoil therefore was among the nobility and the Officer Corps itself, acutely  
aware of its loss of status as a result of its war lord's departure. The officers, who had once been  
a race apart, and were still outside the jurisdiction of civil courts, were to remember the  
revolution primarily as a popular outrage in which the nation's warriors were repudiated and  
insulted by those they had protected. They perceived the country close to chaos, the social  
institutions for which they had fought crumbling away, disorganisation, frustration, hunger and  
want everywhere. Worse, the Bolsheviks, infiltrating and subverting, seemed to be taking over.  
There were clashes between Leftist forces and Army units at Aachen, Cologne, Essen and many  
other places. In Braunschweig a Soldiers' and Workers' Council, greeting a squadron of hussars  
returning from the front, was ridden down for its pains.

The critical point in the Army's fortunes came a few hours before the Armistice was signed. The  
Spartakists — the German Bolsheviks who were to become the German Communist Party —  
were already massing in the streets of Berlin. The civilian power (in the person of President  
Ebert), already fearing that its democratic hours were numbered, struck a bargain with the  
German High Command (in the person of General Gro'ner) to co-operate in the suppression of  
Bolshevism, to restore order, and to maintain military discipline. It saved the Army: the  
Republican government, technically the revolutionary regime, instructed the Soldiers' Councils  
to support their officers without reserve, and within three months the Weimar Assembly was  
meeting under military protection.

For a body of society who by its strategic ambitions and failures had brought Germany so low  
the speed with which the Army effectually achieved the restitution of its privileged position of

power was nothing short of remarkable. Although volunteer Free Corps were used both to  
protect the Weimar meeting and for the suppression of the Spartakist risings in March, by May  
1919 the Army proper had been entirely reorganised, with 400,000 men trained in arms.

However, Germany's failure had not been only in battle. The nation which had learnt before all  
others to make a virtue of war, and to exalt her warriors above all other professions, was bound  
to seek scapegoats when the end came. The myth that the Army was undefeated in the field was  
believed not only because Germany wanted to believe it but because, other factors being equal,  
military defeat was not credible. If what Hindenburg was coolly to term 'the lamentable outcome  
of the war' were not the fault of the Supreme Command, then it had logically to be the fault of  
someone or something else. Yet when the war was over and recriminations began it genuinely  
did not seem to occur to the Supreme Command, who had kept the civilian government largely  
in the dark about the true war prospects throughout the summer of 1918, that the breakdown of  
the military machine — that complex synthesis of munitions, men and morale — stemmed as  
much from economic mismanagement as anything else.

It may have been true — there is no reason to doubt it — that a short, sharp war and a speedy  
victory in 1914 had been both hoped for and expected. Together with the prospect of eventual  
war indemnities extorted from the Entente, this would possibly have justified taking temporary  
liberties, even outrageous ones, with the known laws of finance. The spoils of conquest might  
well have outweighed the losses of running an autarky for a short time: it was Germany's stated  
intention to take over France's colonies. Nevertheless, the fact that the same monetary policies  
were pursued without serious change not only when it was evident that no quick victory was  
possible (a matter about which the financial authorities may have been broadly ignorant), but  
when peace came and for years afterwards, would seem to discredit any notion that the German  
inflation began with a temporary expedient. However, although paper notes had been legal  
tender since 1910, that was indeed how it did begin: in part the natural result of having a self-  
willed Army itching for war and a Federal Parliament which, though with limited power over the  
country's constituent states, still had to find the money to pay for it.

The first stage of inflation took place under the auspices of one Karl Helfferich, State Secretary  
for Finance from 1915 to 1917. Before 1914, the credit policy of the Reichsbank had been  
governed by the Bank Law of 1875, whereby not less than one-third of the note issue had to be  
covered by gold and the remainder by three-month discounted bills adequately guaranteed. In  
August 1914 action was taken both to pay for the war and to protect the country's gold reserves.  
The latter objective was achieved by the simple device of suspending the redemption of  
Reichsbank notes in gold. The former was contrived by setting up loan banks whose funds were  
to be provided simply by printing them. The loan banks would give credits to business, to the  
Federal states, to the municipalities and to the new war corporations; and, moreover, they were to  
advance money for war bond subscriptions. Loan bank notes, whose denominations ranged from  
one to 50 marks, were to be regarded as legal tender; and those not taken up by the Reichsbank  
were put into immediate circulation. However, the most ominous measure for the future was the  
one which permitted the Reichsbank to include three-month Treasury bills in its note-coverage,  
so that unlimited amounts could be rediscounted against banknotes.

Thus were the Government's plans drawn up, wilfully and simply, for financing the war — not  
by taxation, but by borrowing; and with the printing press as the well to supply both the needs of

the Government and the growing credit demand of private business. Taxation was to play not the  
smallest part in meeting the costs of war before 1916. The Allied blockade of the Central Powers  
threw Germany, which over half a century had grown to be a foremost trading nation, fully back  
on her own resources for fighting the most devastating war in history. It was inevitable that those  
resources would be shot away to nothing: the question was when the bill would be presented, and  
who would pay it.

Germany's total war expenditure was 164,000 million marks; but as the mark's purchasing power  
during the war declined continually, that sum was the equivalent of only about 110,000 million  
pre-war marks (£5,500 million): Mark gleich Mark had already become a fiction. War loans were  
the most important source of this money, the eight issues providing three-fifths of it. The  
remainder was made up by the credit banks who willingly accepted Treasury bills.(of which  
nearly 30,000 million marks' worth were still held outside the Reichsbank when the war ended);  
and by taxation.

This last seems still to have gone against the grain. Helfferich had actually announced to the  
Reichstag in March 1915 that the war was to be financed exclusively by borrowing — so that the  
small amount of tax revenue raised for the purpose, first with a war profits tax and a turnover tax,  
later with a coal and transport tax, was less than 8,000 million marks a year even in 1917. This  
amount covered neither the extra expenditure caused by inflation, nor even the interest burden on  
the war debt: so that war expenditures duly exceeded revenues, and the money in circulation  
increased in 1917 to five times what it had been in 1913. As essential supplies day by day grew  
scarcer the money available to buy them grew proportionately more plentiful. As war-  
profiteering began to flourish — the war profits tax was a political sop, and an ineffectual one,  
rather than a serious fiscal innovation — the influence of the banks on the general economy  
declined in proportion. Even without losing the war, Germany would have had a hard task after  
1918 to straighten out her finances again.

Dr Hjalmar Schacht, who was later to pull the Weimar chestnuts out of the fire as President of  
the Reichsbank, and later still to organise the financial power of Hitler's Germany, thus described  
the mistakes of Helfferich:

Germany tried to meet the colossal costs of the war by an appeal to the self-sacrificing spirit of  
the people. 'I gave gold for iron' was the slogan for the surrender of gold ornaments and  
jewellery. 'Invest in War Loan' ran\* the appeal to the patriotic sense of duty of all classes. Issue  
after issue of War Loan transformed the greater part of German private fortunes into paper  
claims on the State. Our enemies, especially Britain, took another line. They met the cost of war  
with taxes aimed primarily at those industries and groups to whom the war spelled prosperity.  
Britain's policy of taxation proved socially more equitable than Germany's policy of War Loans  
which lost their value after the war was over ...

As the war machine lumbered expensively on, circumstances and policies combined to pull the  
wool over the financial eyes of the German people, not least those classes who had most to lose.  
Every German stock exchange was closed for the duration, so that the effect of Reichsbank  
policies on stocks and shares was unknown. Further, foreign exchange rates were not published,  
and only those in contact with neutral markets such as Amsterdam or Zurich could guess what  
was going on. It was never clear how much the steep rise in domestic prices was due to economy

measures and war shortages rather than to inflation — and even the relevance of those prices was  
rendered dubious by the much higher black market rates. Only when the war was over, with the  
veil of censorship lifted but the Allied blockade continuing, did it become clear to all with eyes  
to read that Germany had already met an economic disaster nearly as shattering as her military  
one. The scales may have fallen at last from German eyes with the coming of peace, but that did  
not mean that the difficulties and injustices created by war-time inflation had passed unnoticed.  
The activities of profiteers were only one source of growing social discontent. The upsetting of  
the old patterns of pay differentials did its share of harm. With the benefit of two years'  
hindsight, The Vossische Zeitung could print in August 1921:

Our military defeat was due to the fact that for every 1000 men we had in the trenches, double  
that number of deserters and embusques remained at home. These deserters were activated less  
by military than economic motives. The rise in prices was mainly responsible for the poverty of  
the families of the enlisted men ... The first to suffer had to be those who did not share in the  
general increase in paper revenue, the soldiers who did not participate in the increase in wages,  
trading profits and war industries ... they realised that their situation and that of their families  
would be hopeless after the war. Hence the dull, often dismal attitude of soldiers on furlough  
from the front during the latter years of the war.

Even in the war years, in other words, inflation was taking its toll on national morale. 'There  
must be some people to whom the war is useful,' argued one of the young soldiers in All Quiet  
on the Western Front; and in the last pages the bitter comment came: 'The factory owners in  
Germany have grown wealthy: dysentry dissolves our bowels.' The newspaper went on to put the  
blame where some of it, at least, belonged:

It must be admitted generally now that the cause of the depreciation of our currency and of the  
purchasing power of the mark was neither the commercial balance during the war nor the  
estimate of our military situation abroad; but in the exploitation of our currency for the purpose  
of obtaining money for the Treasury, that is to say in a fictitious increase of our total income. In  
as much as the country issued milliards in the form of extraordinary levies, War Loans, Treasury  
bills, and so on, without withdrawing from circulation corresponding amounts in the shape of  
taxes, it created new paper income and wealth incessantly, while the real national wealth was  
steadily being diminished by the war.

War had been bad enough for the German economy. The Armistice first, and then the peace  
terms, shook it to the foundations. At Compiegne on November 11, 1918 the surrender of the  
German fleet, withdrawal from Alsace-Lorraine and the immediate evacuation of Belgium and  
France were all expected conditions. Bitterer pills to swallow were the handing over of  
Germany's African colonies and the occupation of the Rhineland by the Allies. However, the  
article which stipulated that the blockade of the Central Powers would go on until the peace  
terms were agreed and signed struck the people hardest. The German standard of living, it was  
estimated, had fallen to about half what it had been before the war. It is indicative that the first  
street demonstration of the revolution in Munich, where 100,000 people took to the streets on  
November 7, was set off by an increase of 6 pfennigs in the price of a litre of beer. Not only  
conscripted soldiers had lost patience.

With Ludendorff's sudden announcement in October 1918 that an armistice had to be obtained  
on virtually any terms, Germany's military dictatorship subsided and the coalition of Majority  
Socialists (SPD), Progressives and Centre which had held together in the Reichstag for the best  
part of two years found itself genuinely in charge, and therefore responsible for picking up the  
pieces. In the immediate anarchic conditions of that autumn, it was inevitable that this  
government should come under almost instant attack from all sides. It assumed its new role with  
trepidation, the government of the revolution, but not itself especially revolutionary. The  
proclamation of the Republic was in part a holding operation against the Bolshevist tide. To the  
Left, the Independent Socialists had been alienated by the SPD's repeated willingness to vote for  
war credits, while the Spartakists were pushing on from extreme to extreme, and did not believe  
in parliamentary rule at all. To the Right, there was no love for republicanism and, in any case,  
that Mathias Erzberger, leader of the Centre Party, had signed the Armistice had put him beyond  
the pale.

January 1919 saw the first elections to the Reichstag since 1912. Over 30 million voters (more  
than 80 per cent of those eligible) produced the coalition which was to face the peace terms  
presented by the Allies in June, The principal constituent was the new Democratic Party, and the  
Democrats were the main authors of the Weimar constitution which was completed in August.  
Sir John Wheeler-Bennett\* (In The Nemesis of Power (Macmillan, 1953), Part I, Chapter i (vii))  
has described the German people in 1919 as deprived of their physical and moral capacity for  
further resistance.

They lacked the power to translate their hatred into active opposition. Instead they cherished it  
within their bosoms, warming themselves with its rancorous fire ...

The coals for this fire were the Versailles peace terms. The Allies offered them without  
significant previous consultation, but the German Government was nevertheless bound to accept  
them under the threat of further heavy sanctions. Until that moment Germany had entertained the  
illusion that the peace would be based on President Wilson's famous 'fourteen points', and that  
the principle of national self-determination would mould the future shape of Europe. It was  
thought that the replacement of the old regime would itself have ensured reasonable terms from  
Germany's enemies; but that was reckoning without the determination of the French, founded on  
fear, or the desire for vengeance, or the pursuit of retributive justice, that any German resurgence  
should be prevented.

The Treaty of Versailles separated Germany not just from her colonies but from one-seventh of  
her pre-war territory — north, south, east and west — as well as from a tenth of her population.  
Under its terms, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, and France was to occupy the  
Rhineland and to exploit the coal of the Saar for fifteen years, after which the Saar's future was  
to be settled by plebiscite. A plebiscite, too, was to determine the future of Upper Silesia in the  
east.

The implications of these truncations for the German economy were of course enormous: and so  
were those of the requirement to reduce the German army to a quarter of its size, for it meant that  
over a quarter of a million more disbanded soldiers were to be thrown on the labour market.  
Work had to be found for them at any cost, or so it was calculated. What spelt doom were the  
clauses that made Germany responsible for the war and demanded colossal reparations — in

money and in kind — to meet the Allies' costs. As was evident again in 1945, war guilt had not  
previously impinged upon German consciousness. When the peace terms were published in  
Berlin in May 1919, reaction set in. The Ministry fell, and a new one bowed at last to the Allies'  
ultimatum. Although the first Weimar Parliament struggled on for another year, it was as though  
a landslide had crashed across the road to economic revival.

Thus within a few months of the Armistice the elements were present for the most devastating  
monetary collapse that any industrialised nation has ever known. Her industrial resources and  
manpower\* heavily reduced, and hopelessly burdened with the insupportable weight of  
reparation payments stretching indefinitely into the future, Germany was required to regain her  
feet in those quicksands of her own making: the financial and fiscal arrangements of the  
Helfferich dispensation.

The state of the mark, meanwhile, had become the barometer both of international confidence in  
Germany and of Germany's national despair. Before the war it had stood at 20 to the pound  
sterling. At the end of the war, in December 1918, it stood at 43. Before the terms of the Treaty  
of Versailles were accepted in June 1919, a pound would buy 60 marks. But when December  
came round again it would buy 185. Already the average annual war-time depreciation of about  
20 per cent had come to resemble stability.

The labour force in the confiscated territories apart, Germany lost 1.6 million dead and suffered  
3'5 million casualties in the war.

### 2: Joyless Streets

THE Treaty of Versailles weakened and diminished Germany, but left her no less a whole  
nation. The parallel peace treaties of St Germain and Trianon not only dismantled the Hapsburg  
Empire in its entirety but respectively whittled down Austria and Hungary to fractions of what  
they had been, and much further than the principal of national self-determination for the empire's  
successor states demanded. Both lost enormous areas of territory and millions of their nationals  
— German Austria mainly to the new Czechoslovakia, Hungary mainly to Rumania. Vienna,  
once an imperial capital, found herself as a vast city without an adequate hinterland to support  
her; and the rump of empire was forbidden to make the one move which made economic sense,  
that of Anschluss with Germany. Revolution turned the Emperor Karl off the throne in Vienna  
and brought a Republican government to power. In Budapest the Bolshevik revolution of Bela  
Kun was succeeded by counter-revolution and, at the beginning of 1920, by the regency of  
Horthy.

The plight of the Austrians, and more particularly of the Viennese, was indeed pathetic after the  
war. Hungary, if only her peasants had been more willing to share their produce with the starving  
townspeople, would have been self-sufficient in respect of the necessities of life. That was not so  
of the remnant of Austria, where cold and hunger set in in earnest in the first post-war winter,  
and where the returning soldiers, defeated, angry and exhausted, were if possible more  
susceptible than in Germany to inflammatory talk. Often Vienna and its neighbourhood could  
exist only upon what Germany had to spare, which was not much. In consequence, the  
depreciation of the Austrian krone advanced during the first post-war years far ahead of that of  
the mark, and with even less chance of recovery.

Politically Austria was in desperate shape, and looked in vain to the new government to restore  
either order or prosperity. Mr G. M. Young, who arrived in Vienna in 1920, reported after 18  
months to the British Treasury in a passage which had Lord Curzon, the Foreign Secretary, to  
whom it was passed, calling for more:

Out of the capital and dynastic patrimony of a great empire, the Treaty of St Germain created a  
Republic. Nominally at least, it made this oddly mixed community of bankers and peasants  
responsible for the cost of a great war. In such a world of make-believe it is not always easy,  
even for a foreigner, to keep his mind fixed on the realities of the new position. For many native  
officials and politicians it has so far been impossible ... Nearly all the Departmental buildings of  
the Monarchy are still in occupation, and are lighted, heated, cleaned and so forth for the  
officials of a Republic of only six million souls. A Roman who was born under Theodosius and  
died under Romulus Augustulus had seventy years in which to pass through the changes which  
Austria has seen in three.

The Constitution of the country is a kind of super-democracy, contrived to ensure that as little  
authority as possible is exercised by anyone. The Provinces defy the Federation; the Federal  
Government dare not use the economic weapon which their bankruptcy puts into its hands. The  
President is a purely ceremonial figure: he opens flower shows and legitimates bastards. He does  
not appoint ministers (even nominally) and he cannot dissolve the House. Nor can the  
Government. Legally the Chamber is supreme: it appoints the Cabinet by vote; it decrees its own

dissolution. Actually all business is done by standing committee, of which the public hears little,  
or preferably in the clubs and party meetings, of which they hear at any rate very little that is true  
... The political parties strike me as combining the worst parts of an Approved Society with the  
worst parts of the British Medical Association, and I might add that the mental processes of the  
Pan-Germans constantly recall to my mind those of a certified midwife ...

The truth is that Austria was quite unripe for the advanced parliamentary system which the  
revolution gave her.

That was the institutional background for an immense amount of human misery. At the outbreak  
of war the Austrian krone had been nearly on a par with the mark. By the war's end inflation had  
pushed them apart, to the krone's great disadvantage. Official prices in either case seldom  
reflected the true black market costs, and in Vienna where food shortage was acute the black  
market was for many the only sufficient source. Thus in 1914 in Vienna a kilogram of best wheat  
flour cost 44 heller (the equivalent of about 6d sterling); but in December 1918, with wheat flour  
unobtainable anywhere, the indefinable mixture which masqueraded as flour could be procured  
from an illicit dealer at 22 kronen a kilo — exactly fifty times as much.

In 1914 a pound sterling was worth about 25 kronen. By May, 1922, when the pound could still  
purchase only 1200 marks, it would have bought 35,000 kronen.

The force of such conditions on the Austrian bourgeoisie was vividly shown in the early Greta  
Garbo film The'Joyless Street, made in Vienna by Pabst in 1925. As the symbol of untouchable  
purity in a milieu of want, greed and corruption, finally finding truth and happiness in the arms  
of an American volunteer, Garbo's role may lack persuasion today; but from the odious butcher  
insulting and taunting the food queues at his shop, refusing meat to women he found unattractive  
or unwilling, to the scenes of the unlicensed, gluttonous revelry of the nightlife of the speculator  
and profiteer, and to the ultimate attack by a starving, angry crowd on a cafe full of merrymakers  
— the film was a faithful reflection of the times.

A more telling contemporary account of the scourge of inflation in post-war Vienna is given in  
the diary, greatly overladen with explanatory translation for English-speaking readers, of Anna  
Eisenmenger. As the ex-Imperial Army drifted homewards, armed and in revolutionary mood,  
and as the food shortage of the war years turned to famine, this middle-class widow found  
herself progressively turning to illegal practices to keep her family going — a war-blinded son, a  
tubercular daughter, a son-in-law with amputated legs, a hungry grandson, and another son who  
had become a Communist. She began to resort at enormous expense to the Schleichhcindler —  
the smugglers — for the most basic foods which, despite ration cards, the State could no longer  
supply. 'Hamstering' — hoarding — though an indictable offence, became no more than  
commonsense. Pitifully aware of her family's lowering standard of living and social status, Frau  
Eisenmenger was nevertheless lucky in having investments which in 1914 brought her nearly  
5,000 kronen a year — equal to about £200.

She recorded that in October 1918 when she resolved to cash 20,000 kronen worth for immediate  
use, her bank manager advised her earnestly to convert all her money into Swiss francs.  
However, private dealings in foreign currencies were illegal, and she decided that to break the  
law against the hoarding of fuel and food was enough.

I must make myself believe \[she wrote\] that I am really far better off than hundreds of thousands  
of other women. I am at least immune from material cares and can help my children since I have  
a small fortune, safely invested in gilt-edged securities. Thank God for that!

She also had a substantial quantity of her husband's cigars, which could be traded for meat or  
other food as the opportunity arose: an important enough means of survival even during the early  
months of the post-war blockade.

But the country was now deprived both of Czech coal and Hungarian food; and within a month  
of the end of the war Austrian currency began to lose its exchange value at a far greater rate than  
before. By December 1918, when all businesses were forced to employ an allocation of  
demobilised soldiers whether or not extra staff were required, bankruptcies were common. That  
month Frau Eisenmenger's legless son received 35,000 kronen in 'caution money', which he  
decided to keep safely until the value of the krone increased again; but in the meantime he  
converted it into War Loan. In December, too, as an anti-inflationary measure, all paper money  
had to be overprinted 'Deutschosterreich'. Frau Eisen-menger, who took what remained of her  
20,000 kronen to the bank to be stamped, recorded the first evidence she heard that ruin lay in  
front of her:

In the large banking hall a great deal of business was being done ... All around me animated  
discussions were in progress concerning the stamping of currency, the issue of new notes, the  
purchase of foreign money and so on. There were always some who knew exactly what was now  
the best thing to do! I went to see the bank official who always advised me. 'Well, wasn't I right?'  
he said. 'If you had bought Swiss francs when I suggested, you would not now have lost three-  
fourths of your fortune'. 'Lost!' I exclaimed in horror. 'Why, don't you think the krone will  
recover again?' 'Recover!' he said with a laugh ... 'Just test the promise made on this ao-kronen  
note and try to get, say, 20 silver kronen in exchange'. 'Yes, but mine are government securities:  
Surely there can't be anything safer than that?' 'My dear lady, where is the State which  
guaranteed these securities to you? It is dead ..."

Discovering that her son's War Loan had already become unsaleable, Frau Eisenmenger was then  
induced to exchange her government securities for industrial shares. Her grandson developed  
scurvy. Two days after Christmas, the first food train arrived in Vienna from Switzerland. The  
prices of the new food, strictly rationed as it was, were four times as high as the previous official  
prices. Other food was hardly available for money, and could be obtained principally by barter.  
'Panic bids defiance to all legal decrees', runs the diary entry for January 1, 1919.

Even the most respectable of Austrian citizens now breaks the law, unless he is prepared to  
starve for the sake of obeying it ... The fact that the future is so uncertain has led to stagnation in  
industry and public works, and swelling numbers of unemployed supported by the State ... yet it  
is impossible to get domestic servants or indeed any sort of workers ...

Heightened class-consciousness is daily being instilled into the manual workers by the Socialist  
government, and, in heads bewildered by catchwords, leads to an enormously exaggerated  
estimate of the value of manual labour. Only in this way could it come about that the wages of  
manual workers are now far higher than the salaries of intellectual workers. Even our otherwise

honest old house-porter is demanding such extravagant sums for performing little jobs that I  
prefer to do the heavier and more unpleasant household work myself ...

I survey my remaining 1,000-kronen notes mistrustfully, lying by the side of the pack of  
unredeemed food cards in the writing table drawer. Will they not perhaps share the fate of the  
food cards if the State fails to keep the promise made on the inscription on every note? The State  
still accepts its own money for the scanty provisions it offers us. The private tradesman already  
refuses to sell his precious wares for money and demands something of real value in exchange.  
The wife of a doctor whom I know recently exchanged her beautiful piano for a sack of wheat  
flour. I, too, have exchanged my husband's gold watch for four sacks of potatoes, which will at  
all events carry us through the winter ... My farmer had hidden the sacks of potatoes under straw  
on top of which he placed some apples. The apples were duly stolen, but the potatoes reached me  
safely ... I had to give the porter half a sack as hush-money ... When the farmer's eyes rested on  
the grand piano at which Erni \[her blinded son\] was seated improvising, he took me aside and  
said: 'My wife has been wanting one of those things for a long time. If you'll give it to me, you  
shall have all you want for three months

Although the misery of Austria was more immediately and directly the result of war, the pattern  
was to be repeated almost exactly in Germany. In both countries rapid inflation caused  
homegrown produce to be withheld from the urban markets, with hunger and anger the inevitable  
result. All Austrians, but especially those with savings, watched horrified as the value of their  
money fell, Frau Eisenmenger among them. She noted early in 1919:

The State has been obliged to put 10,000 kronen notes into circulation — each equivalent to two  
years' income from my capital. A suit costs about six times what it was in 1913, but some things  
like food are a hundred or two hundred times as much ... Paper clothes are being sold. Never had  
I dreamed it possible that one could purchase so little for 10,000 kronen ... Jealousy and envy  
flourish in this atmosphere, and if one has procured some harmless article of food, one is careful  
to conceal the fact from one's fellow men. Hunger reigns inexorably and selects its dumb and  
uncomplaining victims above all from the middle classes ...

Spring saw no alleviation of the troubles of those with no political leverage to bargain with. Not  
only Austrian peasants and profiteers took advantage of their helplessness. Furniture, fittings,  
pianos and carpets were being bought up wholesale by what were known as the 'gold-currency'  
people — the occupying Italians, the British, the Americans. The last valuables of countless  
houses flowed on to the market, no one warning their owners not to part with goods whose  
intrinsic value remained unimpaired.

The Viennese \[commented Frau Eisenmenger\], handed a large bundle of kronen, still thinks he  
has grown richer, without taking into account the enormous rise in prices resulting from the  
Zurich quotations which come as a fresh surprise to him every day.

Where the German looked to the New York and London rates, Vienna's eyes were on the Swiss  
franc.

Twice a day we are all forced to await the quotation of the Zurich bourse. Every fresh drop in its  
value is followed by a wave of rising prices ... The confidence of Austrian citizens in the

currency administration of the State is shaken to its foundation. The State which is perpetually  
printing new banknotes deceives us with the face value ... A housewife who has had no  
experience of the horrors of currency depreciation has no idea what a blessing stable money is,  
and how glorious it is to be able to buy with the note in one's purse the article one had intended  
to buy at the price one had intended to pay.

In November, a year after the Armistice, Frau Eisenmenger wrote that her position was  
alarmingly worse, the financial situation beyond her understanding. The krone, at 25 Swiss  
centimes the previous Christmas, was now quoted at one-twelfth of a centime. Her shares,  
however, were going up. Gambling on the stock exchange had become the fashion — the only  
way to avoid losing all one's money and perhaps to add to it. Many new bankers were giving  
people advice, the flight from the krone governing all transactions. 'Meanwhile,' Frau  
Eisenmenger wrote,

the large numbers of unemployed, their passions fermented by the Communists, are seething  
with discontent ... a mob has attempted to set the Parliament building on fire. Mounted  
policemen were torn from their horses, which were slaughtered in the Ringstrasse and the warm  
bleeding flesh dragged away by the crowd ... the rioters clamoured for bread and work ... Side  
by side with unprecedented want among the bulk of the population, there is a striking display of  
luxury among those who are benefitting from the inflation. New nightclubs are being opened.  
These clubs have the further effect of greatly intensifying the class hatred of the proletariate  
against the bourgeoisie.

On December 15 1919, Frau Eisenmenger recorded that, whereas the downward movement of  
the krone in Zurich had gone on, 'the value of my industrial investments is rising to an extent  
which seems to be incomprehensible and almost makes me uneasy ..." Her daughter was able to  
make two dollars a day at the American Mission, which could be exchanged for 400 krone, only  
100 krone less than the monthly pension of a retired privy councillor.

Former civil servants and officers are undoubtedly the poorest of the poor in Austria today. They  
are too proud to press their claims, can get no employment. Thus it happens every day, again and  
again, that elderly, retired officials of high rank collapse on the streets of Vienna from hunger.

Frau Eisenmenger let a room to the gentleman from the American Mission — just as Garbo's  
father in The Joyless Street was able to do — and received for it ten times the rent which, in  
accordance still with the wartime rent restriction Act, she herself paid for the whole flat. On a  
now slender quantity of negotiable cigars, on her daughter's earnings, on that rent, and on the  
diminishing real income from her burgeoning shares, she tackled the first months of 1920.

Speculation on the stock exchange has spread to all ranks of the population and shares rise like  
air balloons to limitless heights ... My banker congratulates me on every new rise, but he does  
not dispel the secret uneasiness which my growing wealth arouses in me ... it already amounts to  
millions.

What was happening to Austria then was simply a foretaste of what was to come to Germany.  
The plight of Frau Eisenmenger and her family would be repeated a thousandfold in every town

in both countries. The torture of Germany's middle classes, however, was more lingering, and  
more intense.

### 3: The Bill Presented

SIGNED on June 29, 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was denounced in Germany by all sides.  
Universal condemnation, however, produced no political unity. Its effect, on the contrary, was to  
give an easy stick to the Right — the Conservatives and the Army — with which to beat a  
government which had to abide by its terms. From then on the struggle was about whether or not  
those terms were to be fulfilled. The ones at issue boiled down to two: the future of the Army,  
which Versailles attempted to reduce to a toothless, token force; and the payment of reparations.

The Army was not destroyed, and indeed had a vital part to play in upholding the Republic as  
that fragile institution was rocked ever more fiercely by the inflationary storm and the political  
troubles which accompanied it. Nominally, certainly, the reduction of the Reichswehr from  
400,000 of June 1919 to the 100,000 demanded by the following March proceeded more or less  
on schedule. General von Seeckt skilfully prised the Army away from the political arena —  
where by and large it remained, a highly efficient, highly trained, easily expandable military  
nucleus. In 1933 it was the last obstacle which might have prevented the onset of the Third  
Reich, in which matter it proved a broken reed.

Neither was what the Army stood for destroyed. Hindenburg duly resigned; but was accorded by  
the newly-elected President Ebert 'the inextinguishable gratitude of the German people'. When  
the Reichstag's commission of inquiry into the responsibility for the war opened — with the  
Cabinet hoping that the old military regime would be thoroughly discredited — the prestige of  
the old Officer Corps, and especially that of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, soared to new heights:  
while the Dolchstoss legend was given wings, the onus of Germany's defeat was hoisted  
permanently on to the backs of the politicians then struggling miserably with its consequences.

As 1919 drew to its close, talk of a military coup, on the cards since the summer, became more  
frenzied. In January 1920, when the treaty came into force, an attempt was made to assassinate  
Erzberger, still regarded by the Right as one of the principal authors of Germany's shame.  
However, the spark which caused the explosion came from without: on February 3 the Allied  
Note was delivered presenting the first list of war criminals to be handed over, including the  
Kaiser, Hindenburg and Ludendorff. Only the extreme Left remained unmoved by what was  
regarded by all others as a callous threat to the nation's war heroes, most of whom had already  
been vindicated in German eyes by the commission of inquiry. It was a short step for the  
universal outrage to be translated into military deed — the Kapp Putsch of March.

This episode was primarily a trial of strength between the Right wing militarists, notably the Free  
Corps who had been suppressing Bolshevism brutally in the Baltic States, and the Republican  
government, with the Army proper sitting on the fence until the cat jumped. The Cabinet, in the  
shape of the Defence Minister, Herr Noske, were determined to enforce the Allies' demand to  
disband two Free Corps brigades (one already with swastikas on its helmets) outside Berlin. The  
reactionary General von Lüttwitz, the Reichswehr's senior commanding officer, knowing that his  
striking force was about to be taken away from him, gave the order to march, but without  
sufficiently warning Dr Wolfgang Kapp, no less a Right-wing, fanatic patriot, who was to take  
political control when the coup was complete. The lawful Cabinet fled to Dresden, but Kapp was

unready to take its place, and the Putsch immediately began to collapse in a welter of  
incompetence and anticlimax.

Kapp's proclamation of himself as the new Chancellor was met by the Republican government  
with the counter-proclamation of a general strike. This proved decisive, because Berlin quickly  
ground to a halt, military enthusiasm for Kapp fell away, and von Lüttwitz was replaced by  
General von Seeckt. The Putsch was over, defeated by the unions. The brief period during which  
many of the Officer Corps actually imagined that the good old days had returned — ex-officers  
were seen to swagger about the streets to the rhythm of patriotic marches — passed away  
swiftly, and the Army's short dalliance with the idea of a new military dictatorship was ended.  
From then on the Army and the State were to work more or less in unison.

March 1920 was something of a watershed in terms of the war's aftermath in Germany. Although  
Right-wing revolt and subversion were to continue, especially in Bavaria where the Kapp Putsch  
had been echoed simultaneously by that of von Kahr, the immediate period of revolution and  
counter-revolution passed. Had other things been equal reconciliation and reconstruction might  
have followed. Although it is unwise to be too rigid in asserting which events most truly affect a  
society's behaviour, one may suggest that after the damp squib of the Kapp Putsch the  
demoralisation and distress of Germany owed less to the mortification of defeat in war than to  
the new, virulent economic and financial afflictions which had become the daily experience.

Some of the poison of northern militarism having, as it were, been drawn off, the disaffected,  
reactionary elements mainly took refuge in the hotbeds of the south. Bavaria then became the  
mainspring of Germany's 400 political murders, mostly unpunished, many unsolved, between  
1919 and 1923: the militarist Right may not have been responsible for more than the lion's share  
of them, but those years were certainly an open season for the officials and supporters of the new  
Republic. Although the weaker minds of the Right still pined for old glories, fresh bursts of  
militancy were as likely to be caused by the economic mess the government was making of the  
peace as by post-war blues or bitterness.

The observed depredations of the Allies, especially the French, were no doubt made the reason  
for popular outbreaks; Hitler's rapid rise to influence in Munich was largely based on his attacks  
upon those who were felt to have betrayed the country in 1918; and the Left was still using the  
lessons of the immediate past to incite social turmoil wherever the opportunity was offered. Yet  
it was the five years of inflation before 1921 which made the soil so fertile for the agitator; and it  
was the continuing, worsening financial predicament in which so many classes found themselves  
which governed social and political development in the ensuing period.

Because the Kapp Putsch had been defeated by a general strike, it was widely supposed that the  
power of the working classes had finally been demonstrated, and that the advent of government  
by the proletariate was only a matter of time. On the contrary, however, the working classes who  
had indubitably established their power directly to interfere with the Cabinet's composition, if  
not in the conduct of affairs, allowed those advantages to go without resistance. The  
circumstances of the strike were of course exceptional, for it had stemmed from a government  
initiative and had the Cabinet's support. Yet it seemed that the parliamentary government had  
defeated its reactionary foe only by conjuring up a dangerous spirit which might have been better  
unroused. Such was not the case; and Lord Kilmarnock,\* ("Later 2ist Earl of Enroll. From 1921-

1928 he was British High Commissioner of the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission. Born  
1876, died 1941.) then British Charge d'Affaires in Berlin, thought 'the proletariate had  
discovered that the misery resulting from such a strike fell largely upon itself.'

Misery, however, was already present in abundance, and the trade unions' energies were shortly  
to be directed almost exclusively at winning wage increases for their members in some way in  
line with the mounting cost of living: for the time being, a pliant government and an even more  
pliant monetary system seemed to be all they wanted. The facts of life, after all, were plain  
enough to them as Christmas 1920 approached.

The cost of living since the outbreak of the war had risen by nearly twelve times (compared with  
three times in the United States, almost four times in Britain and seven times in France). Food  
had accounted for half the family budget then, but now nearly three-quarters of any family's  
income went on it. The food for a family of four persons which cost 60 marks a week in April  
1919, cost 198 marks by September 1920, and 230 marks by November 1920. Certain items such  
as lard, ham, tea and eggs rose to between thirty and forty times the pre-war price. On the bright  
side - in contrast to Austria - the official unemployed figure was low, and only 375,000 people  
were on the dole.

There was, on the other hand, the hope that things would get better. As business improved in the  
summer of 1920, a more tolerable standard of living for the working classes came into prospect.  
There had been resentment when strikes in the essential services were made illegal, and towards  
the end of the year there was considerable unrest among State employees, particularly in the post  
office and the railways: that unrest, indeed, led to more strikes and to uneconomic concessions  
by the government. None the less, a certain revival of the national spirit and a will to work was  
noticeable, even among Germany's miners. The idea of a better future in fact had substance to it.  
The standard of living in Germany had fallen steeply during the war, whereas in France and  
Britain it had actually risen a few percentage points. A small rise in German standards and a  
small fall in British standards, although leaving Britain still far in advance of Germany, would  
notwithstanding create discontent in Britain while leaving the Germans feeling better off.

The British consul in Leipzig, as one dispassionate observer, was optimistic. Although there was  
still 'much dissatisfaction in the working class' and Communist propaganda and agitation  
continued, he reported that discipline had returned, and that those same workers, now apathetic  
and weary of political dispute, felt some improvement in conditions of life.

I am left with the impression \[he wrote\] that wages and the cost of living have now reached an  
equilibrium, and that the purchasing power of wages is nearly equal to that of before the war. But  
there is still much insecurity of life and property, and acts of violence are frequently reported...  
The middle class, i.e. persons with fixed incomes from investments or pensions and government  
officials are perhaps the most hard hit, and it can readily be realised that what before the war had  
been a fair competence - I speak of incomes up to 10,000 marks a year - is now entirely  
inadequate for the barest necessities.

He reported finally that Saxon industry was in a very satisfactory condition, making a good  
recovery though working only the new eight-hour day, and with many orders in hand.

Indeed, the apparent health of industry was one of the factors which most effectively confused  
the inflation issue. Bolstered by a financial programme geared to subsidising in various vital  
ways an industrial front which continuous depreciation of the currency had already made highly  
competitive in foreign markets, the lot of German industry had materially improved over the  
previous twelve months. Industrialists, taking care to express the extremest pessimism to  
foreigners, were agreed that a reversion to the ten-hour day was essential in the circumstances;  
but in fact the miners, who with the support of their colleagues in Britain and France were not  
disposed to lengthen their shifts, were working well; and most workers, von Thyssen believed,  
had now realised that work rather than political dogma was the answer to their difficulties.

Alas, not only were the hopes of the German working classes shortly to be dashed: there were no  
such hopes at all for the broader spectrum of the German people who had no unions to protect  
their short-term interests and no stake in the monopoly power of organised labour. Two  
developments in 1920 were storm-cones for the future. The elections of June, although returning  
a central coalition to power under Herr Fehrenbach as Chancellor and with Dr Wirth at the  
Finance Ministry, demonstrated the political polarisation of the country in the meantime: the  
German National People's Party (DNVP) on the far Right trebled its vote, while that of the  
Independent Socialists on the far Left was doubled. The moderate coalition of the Democrats and  
Majority Socialists had lost much of the voters' confidence.

Secondly, there took place in July the Spa conference in Belgium, the first of the numerous post-  
Versailles meetings to discuss the payment of war reparations and kindred matters arising from  
the peace treaties. Reparations questions naturally directly affected confidence in the mark and,  
indeed, the whole question of the German economy, but they were postponed until a further  
meeting in Geneva. That conference'also fell through, and the issue was remitted to yet another  
meeting in Brussels in December.

The uncertainties to which these postponements gave rise in large measure accounted for the  
wild fluctuations of the mark during the year. At the outbreak of war the paper marks in  
circulation in Germany had a total face value of 2,700 million marks (less than half of the value  
of the coinage which the population were encouraged to trade in in return for paper). After the  
war's end, in November 1918, the figure had risen to 27,000 million; and by November 1920 to  
77,000 million. But the pound sterling now stood at 240 marks, the dollar at 60. During 1920  
when the Allies' Reparations Commission began its work, the mark swung from 230 to the  
pound sterling down to 152 and back again. The low point was reached when, for almost the first  
and last time, the actual final amount due in reparations appeared to be reasonably settled.\* (M.  
Poincare, soon to become Prime Minister of France, did not believe in a fixed sum and resigned  
the chairmanship of the commission.) As the mark improved, so unemployment rapidly rose,  
reaching 6 per cent of the work force in the summer of 1920 — a condition which a 'buyers  
strike' may have worsened. Full employment thereafter became a primary objective of both  
government and unions, at the mark's expense.

Lord D'Abernon, who was to be British Ambassador in Berlin for more than six years, arrived at  
his post in June 1920. A man more practically versed in money matters than most in office in  
that city, he dutifully recorded both in his diaries and in. his despatches home the mark's precise  
course over the brink and far down into the depths. Enjoying the fullest confidences of German  
ministers wrestling with the twin problems of inflation and reparations, yet unable to influence

their monetary policy to any important effect, he watched helplessly as, against every warning he  
could give, the chickens of unlimited deficit financing swarmed in to roost.

His warnings went as much to the Allies as to the Germans. The German budget barely balanced  
as it was, leaving nothing for war indemnities. To raise enough money to meet the level of  
reparations discussed in June would require almost twice the revenue which the latest tax  
proposals were expected to produce. 'It is altogether impossible to conceive that twice the new  
rate of taxation could be imposed,' wrote Lord D'Abernon, 'without producing a revolution.'

Inflation provided the answer to the equation. If a budget did not balance, the deficit had to be  
made good somehow. In October 1920 Germany's national debt stood at 287,800 million marks.  
At the old 1914 parities this sum equalled £14,400 million; but at the new it represented only  
£1,200 million.\* (Great Britain's national debt amounted then to £8,075 million.) A year before  
Germany's great inflation is generally thought to have started, Germany's national debt had all  
but been wiped out.

Whom did that benefit? D'Abernon speaking to two members of 'the old Imperial Foreign Office'  
found their attitude one of unmitigated gloom. All their banker friends were sending money out  
of Germany, a process which no amount of restriction could prevent. Non-payment of taxes, they  
said, was 'no longer a crime but a patriotic duty.' The President of the Reichstag, the Liberal-  
minded Loebe, was no less pessimistic, especially concerning the conditions of nourishment  
which he regarded as inviting action from the Left.

'I know from the case of my own children how badly people are fed,' Loebe said. 'You cannot get  
milk, and an egg costs 2% marks. The financial condition of the middle classes, the small  
employers and so on is even worse than that of the working class, to which I belong. Only today  
we had a memo from the lower officials in South Germany saying that if their pay was not  
increased they would wreck the till. Working-class wages have roughly been increased eight to  
ten times compared with pre-war; smaller salaries have only been increased two to four times.  
This makes an impossible situation when the cost of living has gone up tenfold.'

The year 1920 ended with the Brussels conference, which met to consider Germany's capacity  
for payment of reparations. It led only to the Paris conference, at the end of January 1921, where  
France, herself not far from insolvency, began making demands on Germany which D'Abernon  
described quite simply as 'amazing'. The figures that came out of Paris for German consideration,  
although nowhere near what the French had demanded, provoked shock in Germany. That  
reaction in turn led in February to another conference in London, where Germany's counter-  
proposals were studied. In the course of these discussions which lasted until the second half of  
March, France lost patience with the Germans and, by way of sanctions under the peace treaty,  
the Rhine ports of Duisburg, Ruhrort and Düsseldorf were occupied by the Allies. On March 30,  
talks began in London again.

Already, though, the reparations question was bearing acutely on German economic life. A few  
days before the -Rhine ports were occupied, the British High Commissioner in Coblenz reported  
to London that

a large majority of the German people did not realise all that the Treaty of Versailles entailed.  
Probably by a large number of the lower classes it was not even read, and the result is that at the  
present time it has dawned on the population of Germany for the first time that the day of  
reckoning has arrived.\* (Lord Curzon wrote in pencil in the margin of this report: 'The idea of  
the "lower classes" "reading" the treaty is humorous.')

The new military sanctions produced a reaction at the other end of the social scale; and Lord  
D'Abernon remarked that there was 'a decided reversion to Junkerism, and I hear that in many of  
the officers' clubs quasi-penal lists are drawn up of those officers who associate with ex-enemies.  
The application of the military sanctions has not produced a normal or healthy reaction — it has  
turned the Germans sour.'

Feeling against France was particularly bitter. France's attitude under the premiership of M.  
Briand was acidly but accurately summed up by Lloyd George whom D'Abernon found in the  
Cabinet Room in Downing Street just before the reparation conference one morning, 'as usual, a  
roaring fire behind his back and an open window in front of him.' The French, said the Prime  
Minister, 'can never make up their mind whether they want payment or whether they want the  
enjoyment of trampling on Germany, occupying the Ruhr, or taking some other military action.  
It is quite clear they cannot have both.'

On April 27 1921, the Reparations Commission fixed Germany's total liability at 132,000 million  
gold marks, equivalent to £6,600 million. The problem before the London conference was how,  
and over what period, that enormous sum should be paid. It was decided that Germany was to be  
asked to pay 2,000 million gold marks -£100 million — a year and, in addition, a sum equal to  
26 per cent of her exports; and these terms were conveyed to Berlin accompanied by the threat of  
further sanctions — namely the occupation of the Ruhr which the French were pressing for — if  
compliance did not come within the week. This 'London Ultimatum', which drove the mark to  
268 to the pound, caused the Fehrenbach government to fall. It was supplanted by that of Dr  
Wirth who, as the new Chancellor, just before the French Army started to roll again, accepted  
those terms knowing that heavy additional taxation would have to be imposed on the nation. The  
mark thereupon advanced to 232 to the pound as the atmosphere of financial uncertainty briefly  
retreated and the outlook for credit abroad improved. A further reason for optimism was that the  
plebiscite just completed in Upper Silesia, whose industries were of considerable importance to  
the German economy, had resulted in a palpable majority of the people in favour of adhering to  
Germany.\* (More heads voted for Germany, but more communes for Poland.) There was also  
general relief that a Communist-inspired armed rising by the miners of Mansfeld collapsed in  
ignominy — even causing Lenin in Moscow to despair of a new German revolution.

Unfortunately, as spring turned to summer, there was much more that was not well. The  
occupation of the Rhine ports continued. Worse than that, the money supply was growing more  
prodigiously than ever. 'So far from the printing press having stopped printing notes,' D'Abernon  
wrote to Curzon,. 'it has recently resumed its activities to a quite undesirable degree.' The reason  
for that at a stage when the cost of reparations had still not begun to bite was quite simply that  
insufficient revenue was being collected:

'Taxation is enormous,' wrote Mr Howard Hodgkin.\*\* (The Oxford historian, Provost of Queen's  
College, 1937-1946.)

To say that it is less per head than in England \[Lloyd George's complaint\] is simply misleading,  
if not absolutely untrue. The yearly deficiency in the railways alone is 17,000 million marks. The  
extravagance of the rich one hears of is very sad, but it is said to be largely due to high taxation,  
as they feel that unless they spend it the government will get most of it ... Unfortunately the  
persons from whom it is most difficult to collect taxes are those who most should pay, that is to  
say war profiteers and particularly traders in contraband goods who in many cases have not kept  
accounts.

A week after the London Ultimatum had been accepted, Mr Piggott, the Inter-Allied Rhineland  
High Commissioner at Cologne, reported a conversation with the Oberburgermeister, Dr Konrad  
Adenauer, who said that he had been offered the chancellorship before Dr Wirth had accepted it.  
Adenauer's conditions had been the return of the nine-hour day, an end to talk of socialisation  
and complete power to select his ministers from whatever party he chose. It was his view that  
Germany needed a government with almost dictatorial powers capable of enforcing an intensive  
production programme and the strictest universal taxation. 'Dr Adenauer's personal ambition,'  
wrote Piggott, 'is well-known, and the idea of a dictatorial government with himself as dictator  
no doubt appeals to his imagination.' The proposal which kept Dr Adenauer out of power at this  
early date was apparently that of abolishing the eight-hour day. In any event, it meant that no  
government capable of competent tax-collection was in sight.

In June 1921, Dr Walther Rathenau, whose name was to become closely linked with the policy  
of fulfilment of the reparations demands, assumed office as Minister of Reconstruction. The first  
payments of £50 million in gold and Treasury bills were duly made to the Reparations  
Commission during the second week of the month. On June 21, Herr Gareis, a Socialist deputy  
in the Reichstag who had spoken out against the Free Corps was murdered, part of the extreme  
Right's campaign to demoralise the Republicans. At the end of June, John Maynard Keynes was  
heard to prophesy that the mark would fall by an average of a point a day against the pound for  
the next two or three years. Otherwise that month, and July too, passed without serious incident,  
beyond some squabbling with Poland over the future of Upper Silesia, a matter which the Paris  
conference which sat during the first half of August referred eagerly to the League of Nations in  
Geneva. For almost nine months the mark had risen and fallen within 15 points on either side of  
250 to the pound. July 1921, was the last month of even relative stability which the old mark was  
ever to experience.

### 4: Delirium of Milliards

'THE delirium of milliards' was a phrase of Rathenau's coining.

'The majority of statesmen and financiers think in terms of paper,' he had written.\* (Berliner  
Tageblatt February 9, 1921.)

They sit in their offices and look at papers which are lying in front of them, and on those papers  
are written figures which again represent papers ... They write down noughts, and nine noughts  
mean a milliard. A milliard comes easily and trippingly to the tongue, but no one can imagine a  
milliard.

What is a milliard? Does a wood contain a milliard leaves? Are there a milliard blades of grass in  
a meadow? Who knows? If the Tiergarten were to be cleared and wheat sown upon its surface,  
how many stalks would grow? Two milliards!

Rathenau rightly diagnosed that delirium as an affliction not of the people in general — that was  
to come — but of those who were supposedly in control of the country's finances, who had  
raised the note circulation since the beginning of the year from 73 milliard marks to 80 milliard.  
The immediate blame for the latest fall in the mark, which by the middle of August had slid from  
June's figure of 261 to the pound to 310, was laid squarely by Rathenau (as by Wirth) on the  
reparation payments. The 1,000 million gold marks — money at the pre-war parity — due at the  
end of August had been found, but less than 60 per cent had been raised on realistic terms in  
foreign credits or otherwise. 'Next November, or next spring,' Rathenau said, 'whenever a large  
payment comes, exchange will fall again to a still lower level. This cannot go on.'

The mechanism of depreciation had many wheels, however. A close though unnamed  
confederate of Herr Hugo Stinnes, the industrialist, assessing the situation with great candour a  
few weeks later said that the real breaking point came immediately after the German government  
repaid the loan which had been arranged in England by Herr Mannheimer of Mendelssohn's  
Bank, 'the confidential man' of Dr Rudolf Havenstein, President of the Reichs-bank since 1908.  
Mannheimer, instructed by his chief, went out in August 1921 and started to buy foreign  
currency at any price — 'for Germany had any amount of paper marks but no foreign currency.'  
This was the first signal of

the absolute breakdown in the value of the mark. Since then, foreigners have not speculated to  
the same extent in marks and have kept their holdings, waiting for some improvement. The  
banks, on behalf of their clients and the industrialists, went further and not only sold their marks  
at any price but also started to speculate.

There were four reasons for encouraging such a policy: to enable heavy industry to compete with  
foreign countries, to satisfy the workmen's demands by increasing their wages with worthless  
paper marks, to avoid political troubles and disturbances — and also to prove to the world that  
Germany could not fulfil the Versailles Treaty.

That assessment took a too blinkered view of the other events of that August. The virtual  
collapse of Austria which had already cast a deep gloom over the Paris conference, thoroughly  
alarmed Austria's nearest neighbours. The krone, at 800 eighteen months before, had fallen to  
3,000 to the pound, and was still falling steeply, now apparently in advance of the mark by a  
factor of ten. Confidence was in headlong flight. In Munich, the Bavarian capital, the gloomiest  
forebodings were entertained about the cost of living, deepened by the farmers' scandalous  
profiteering in milk and grain and the news that the Reich was to increase taxes again on sugar  
and beer. The farmers' associations in Lower Bavaria did their best to warn their members about  
over-charging or withholding their produce from the market, but the ill-feeling in the towns  
against the peasants was now thoroughly aroused. The government were unfortunately identified  
with agrarian interests, and were therefore bound to be blamed when the hard-pressed Munich  
municipality, in a flagrant vote-catching move at the beginning of the month, voted against  
dearer bread, tout court. Since dearer bread was already one of the facts of life, this action  
encouraged in advance the inevitable demands for still higher wages.

In the meantime the impatience, fear and prejudice of the Right became more openly expressed,  
reaching its summer climax in a nakedly political, anti-Republic display in Berlin on  
Frontkampf-ertag, War Army Day. On August 24 1921, Ludendorff took the march-past of 2, 000  
war veterans headed by the 39-year-old Prince Eitel Friedrich, second son of the Kaiser. They  
marched under an archway bearing the inscription 'In Kriege Unbesiegt' (unbeaten in war), and  
past the royal box in Paradeschritt, Prince Eitel Friedrich throwing his heels as high as anyone  
else.

Then in front of 20,000 spectators there followed a sermon by the Army chaplain which  
suggested that Germany's greatness could only be recovered by military power, through the  
monarchy and the Hohenzollerns. There were speeches in the same strain by the three generals  
present, Ludendorff, Graf Waldersee and von der Goltz. Von der Goltz, who had commanded the  
Baltic Free Corps, was at pains to attack the 'Jew Government', and thus caused some anti-  
Semitic incidents in the crowd; but he stole the limelight in any case by producing telegrams of  
congratulations not only from Admiral Scheer and Grossadmiral von Tirpitz, but from Hinden-  
burg and the ex-Kaiser himself. This last apparently caused 'rausch-ender Jubel' and long,  
continued cheers for the Hohenzollerns. The arena in which the display took place was lined by  
two or three thousand youths and girls, two-deep, the precision of whose drill and military  
movements was (said one eye-witness) 'most striking'.

Such inopportune demonstrations were not confined to the capital, nor to the military. An  
honorary degree of doctor of medicine was conferred that same day on Ludendorff by the  
University of Konigsberg. The diploma was presented in an unctuous tribute 'to the hero who  
with the sharp edge of his unbroken sword defended the German nation, hemmed in by a world  
of enemies all greedy for booty, till that nation, trustful of lying promises, abandoned its  
unconquered Army and its strong leader; to the German, whose picture, shining from the  
darkness of our present hour, gives us faith that the future will bring a Saviour and Avenger for  
our people ..."

The Defence Minister, Dr Gessler, a civilian notoriously under the thumb of the Army, to his  
credit publicly described all this 'rattling of an empty scabbard' as ridiculous. The Berlin M or  
gen-post with some restraint said that the university's effusion 'ill befitted a body of professors in

whose hands lay the education of German youth, and provided a commentary on the reactionary  
attitude of the literati of Germany in general and of East Prussia in particular.'

The Konigsberg apostrophe must have read oddly indeed to those who remembered that at the  
moment when the sword of the German High Command lay, so to speak, broken to bits in the  
wood at Compiegne, Ludendorff was already in flight to Sweden, disguised in blue spectacles. It  
was certainly not the nation which had abandoned its leader. Perhaps the professors need not be  
judged too harshly. The academic class had suffered as heavily as any from the fall of the mark,  
and were unaccustomed to a situation in which (to quote a contemporary) 'the scholarly writer  
does not earn as much with a printed line as the street sweeper earns with two whisks of the  
broom.' They were as liable as any to blame their very considerable woes on the new order, and  
to do so to the advantage of the military clique who had run the country in the good old days.  
However, a convinced pacifist, Herr von Gerlach, writing in Die Welt next day, did not hesitate  
to put them straight:

Ludendorff, far from justifying the terms of the diploma, by his obstinacy and by his meddling in  
politics was responsible not only for the unnecessary prolongation of the war but also for the  
disastrous terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

Gerlach reminded the professors that Ludendorff had telegraphed to Berlin over and over again  
in October 1918, saying that a peace offer had to be made at once as the Army could not hold out  
another 48 hours.

They put Erzberger at the head of the Armistice Commission — an insane choice, but remember  
that he first heard of the abdication of the Kaiser in the Bois de Compiegne, where he also got  
the wire from Hindenburg ending 'if you can't force these points through, conclude an armistice  
anyhow'.

Frontkdmpfertag expressed a spirit of reaction that was rife in Germany from north to south.  
Flesh was being added to the skeletal myth of the Dolchstoss. Two days later, on August 36,  
Mathias Erzberger himself, to the Right the embodiment of civilian treachery, was murdered by  
Nationalist gunmen in the Black Forest. It is not fanciful to suppose that this deed was largely  
inspired by the speeches of the Nationalist (DNVP) leader Karl Helfferich, the wartime Minister  
of Finance under whose auspices the German inflation first got a grip. Erzberger was not only a  
civilian and a Republican but a Jew.

The outside world watched with deep misgivings. In an article in Le Peuple, a Belgian Socialist  
deputy remarked that

assassination seems now to have become the rule in Germany, where militarist brutes, after  
having practised on thousands of Belgians whom they massacred, continue to adopt this means  
of suppressing those in their way ... it is a very grave sign of collective criminal degeneration,  
which must strike all Germans who have retained feelings of respect for human life.

In Germany itself, the death of Erzberger, that most fearless exponent of Socialist taxation, let  
loose a torrent of abuse against the Right. In Berlin the Majority Socialists and the Independent  
Socialists joined forces in a demonstration to protest 'against the enemies of the Republic'. One  
Herr Harden, whom Lord D'Aber-non described as an acute if somewhat acid observer,

explained to the British Ambassador that 'the followers of the Right were perpetually hunting for  
the old culprits responsible for the downfall of the empire and the old system, but instead of  
attacking the generals — Ludendorff and company — who were really the cause, or the old gang  
of princes and sycophants, they reviled the Jews and assassinated the leaders of the Left together  
with those who did not take their own perverted view.' More than three hundred assassinations  
among the leaders of the Left had been perpetrated since the Armistice, Herr Harden said, 'and  
no one is punished.' (He himself had had fifty telephone calls to warn him that he was next on  
the black list, and was leaving for America.)

The Chancellor, Dr Wirth, expressed to D'Abernon his confidence that public order could be  
maintained, although admitting that several newspapers, notably in Bavaria, would have to be  
suppressed, and that the working classes were 'extraordinarily excited'. The government's worries  
in fact were more for the economic crisis than for the political one, and although revenue  
appeared to be coming in quite well at that point, better was expected with the new taxation  
programme. It was hoped to reconcile the Left to the principle of indirect taxation by increasing  
again the taxation on capital. The recent fall in the exchange, Wirth concluded, and the  
consequent rise in the cost of living had forced him to grant new increases of salaries and wages  
of about 10 milliards.

The economic crisis, too, was behind the troubles in Bavaria, where agitation continued unabated  
against the rise in food prices, a development employed unhesitatingly by the Socialists as a  
weapon against the state government. 'The Socialist trade unions are to hold a mass meeting this  
evening,' reported the British Consul-General in Munich, Mr William Seeds,\* (later Sir William  
Seeds, British Ambassador at Moscow 1939-1940.) on the day of Erzberger's murder,

to protest against the increased cost of living and against the reactionary tyranny of Dr von  
Kahr's state government. The 'class-conscious workman' will be urged to carry out a gigantic  
demonstration through the streets undeterred by thoughts of the machine-guns and armoured cars  
of Herr Poehner, the Chief of Police. This official, with that curt firmness which makes him so  
obnoxious to the Socialists, has reinforced the government's warning with a terse little  
proclamation ending with these words: 'If you don't want to be hurt tonight, keep off the streets!'

In the event the mass meeting of about 50,000 people went off without serious disturbance.  
Poehner — one of the earlier converts to National Socialism — kept his men quiet, and only one  
demonstrator was killed and another wounded in a scuffle with the police late in the proceedings.  
'The Socialists,' Mr Seeds subsequently reported, 'will find the proletariate a most dangerously  
useful tool where more material considerations than political agitation are concerned.' They had  
passed a resolution requiring wages to be fixed according to world rates, 'never forgetting the  
fact that the welfare of the people depends solely on the overthrow of the present capitalistic  
system.'

The signing on August 25 1921 of the separate peace treaty between Germany and America,  
which neither mentioned the League of Nations nor sought to blame anyone for the war, might  
well have been a signal for universal relief and celebration. In the event, it did nothing to calm  
either fears or tempers, within Germany or without. The fact was that the new run on the mark  
was set off not merely by the irresponsible behaviour of the banks, nor in consequence of the  
government's inevitable failure by orthodox methods to raise the cash to pay the August

reparations bill, but owing to a host of circumstances, including the murder of Erzber-ger, which  
undermined any remaining confidence that the German economy might be allowed to recover its  
health.

The international financial community was perhaps the first to appreciate the position. No help  
was available for the Reichsbank but on the most onerous terms. A September conference in  
Berne of bankers from Switzerland, Italy and Germany soberly concluded that it was impossible  
for Germany to continue her payments to the Entente and that sooner or later she would have to  
declare herself bankrupt, followed (they thought) by first France and then Italy. The mark, at 310  
to the pound in mid-August, had sped downwards to over 400 by mid-September, and was still  
going down.

On September 20, 1921, Mr Joseph Addison,\* (later Sir Joseph Addison. He was Charge  
d'Affaires in Berlin on several occasions. Born 1879, died 1953.) Councillor at the British  
Embassy in Berlin, reported to the Foreign Office:

The daily creation of fresh paper money which the government requires in order to meet its  
obligations both at home and abroad (services and goods which it is 'obliged both to render and  
deliver') inevitably decreases the purchasing value of the mark and leads to fresh demands,  
which in turn bring about a further decline, and so on ad infinitum.

Even progressive increases in taxation could not completely meet the situation, since new  
impositions meant an increased cost of living, which automatically reduced the purchasing value  
of the mark, and in turn brought about more inflation and budget instability.

'There is enormous speculation,' Addison continued.

Millions of persons in this country are, I think accurately, reported to be buying foreign  
currencies in anticipation of fresh tax burdens, and to be hoarding foreign bank notes ... I hardly  
know a single German of either sex who is not speculating in foreign currencies, such as  
Austrian crowns, Polish marks and even Kerensky roubles. In as much also as a fall in the value  
of the mark is inevitably accompanied by a rise in the quotation of industrial shares, speculators  
are supposed to be operating systematically to depreciate the mark with a view to reaping the  
benefit of higher quotations in the share market.

There was every incentive for the ordinary citizen to take precautions against further tax  
liabilities. He found himself subject to four principal taxes, assuming that his business was such  
as to escape the corporation tax (Korperschaftssteuer) of up to 20 per cent. There was the once-  
and-for-all increment tax (Vermogenszewach-steuer) on the increase in value of all property  
acquired between 1913 and 1919, and the capital tax (Notopfer) on the value of all possessions  
after the increment tax had been paid. The unearned income tax (Kapitalertragsteuef) of 10 per  
cent was becoming of lesser importance as the real value of unearned income shrank day by day,  
but the ordinary income tax (Einkommensteuer) naturally affected more seriously a wider and  
wider public as money wages rose to keep up with prices and brought more people into its thrall.

Income tax in 1921 started at 10 per cent on the first 24,000 marks earned, rose to 20 per cent on  
the next 60,000 marks, and so on in steps upwards until a maximum of 60 per cent was paid on  
all income over 395,000 marks a year, a sum equivalent in September 1921, to about £1,000 or

$4,200 — a substantial salary in the nineteen-twenties. In the autumn of 1921 the minimum  
income necessary for the existence of a family of four — two adults and two chidren — was just  
less than 24,000 marks (or about £60) a year. As the mark fell and as wages rose, the taxation of  
real income became proportionately greater.

Lord D'Abernon's diary entry for September 30 noted, however, that compared with the year  
before the feeding and clothing of the people, especially children, had markedly improved. In his  
official hat he observed with misgivings that the privations of the war must have given the  
Germans a distinct competitive advantage over populations whose nourishment and consumption  
of luxuries were still near the pre-war standard. It was a fortuitous addition to the other  
substantial benefits that German industry already enjoyed: various government subventions  
whose effect was to cheapen production. Coal was available below cost price in Britain. Bread  
was sold considerably under its open market price. Railway transport was offered at less than  
working costs. The German budget suffered to the immense and continuous gain of German  
commerce and industry.

Not all German traders and industrialists had yet given up hope for the mark, but few were not  
doing their best to protect their businesses in advance — a protection which could only be  
bought at the expense of the State and thus made their fears self-fulfilling. Where possible, they  
tried to create credit balances abroad, usually by direct arrangement with their customers or  
commercial friends: they would under-invoice their exported products sold (for example) in The  
Hague and buy in return imports for which they were over-invoiced. Such manoeuvres had the  
extra advantage of avoiding taxation in Germany.

Carried on on a large scale, this kind of thing would have tended towards the mark's inflation. If  
continued, the eventual outcome would be insolvency for Germany as a country although its  
subjects might hold considerable assets outside. The process was particularly reprehensible not  
simply because the exporter's profit was the country's loss, but because part of that loss was in  
the substantial subsidies — of workers' food and of industry's rail costs — which ensured the  
competitive prices of Germany's manufactured exports. In practice the business of under- and  
over-invoicing was probably not wide-spread, simply because all a German exporter had to do,  
provided he had no need to bring his profits home, was to pay his foreign balances into a foreign  
bank where the tax authorities could not get at them. In any case, so long as plenty of foreign  
currency was received and enough of it returned, the net effect on the mark was likely to be  
beneficial. Mr F. Thelwall, the British Commercial Secretary in Berlin, found more worrying  
symptoms of Germany's troubles. German workmen's wages, he reported in mid-October, as the  
mark approached 500 to the pound sterling, were too low, and the workers were not being fairly  
treated:

The present labour unrest is caused by the fall of the mark and the impending new taxation, both  
of which send the cost of living up. The German manufacturer and trader is making a lot of  
money, both in Germany and abroad, while the State is getting ever nearer bankruptcy. But I do  
not think this is due so much to the fact that the German exporter is accumulating a vast fortune  
in foreign countries as to the wrong financial system of the German government with regard to  
its own budget and to the fact that the government has obligations imposed on it too heavy to  
meet.

The German system of taxation has two chief faults. One is that on paper it is too heavy, and  
therefore places before the citizen the alternative of either being ruined or not paying his taxes,  
and he has no hesitation as to which course he will choose; and the other, that it has involved  
such a large amount of reorganisation of the executive apparatus that it will probably be some  
years before it will become really effective.

In October 1921 the state of the budget was sombre. In terms of paper marks, the sum of the  
government's ordinary expenditure (including the recent 10 milliard wage increase) and the  
estimated payments to the Allies in reparations and occupation costs was 113 milliard marks.  
The revenue from the previous budget and from new taxation proposals of July would amount to  
less than 90 milliards. These calculations were based on a conversion ratio of one gold mark to  
13 paper marks — but already the true rate was 22 to one. The reality was that the total due by  
Germany for contributions to the Allies alone already equalled the total real receipts from the  
ordinary and extraordinary budgets, which would themselves be in balance only if Chancellor  
Wirth's 15 new tax schemes could be brought effectively into force. Under the prevailing  
political conditions, and using the current fiscal system, this was the most dubious proposition. A  
capital levy, for example, which had been demanded by the Socialists in July in the hope of  
tapping real property values, failed to produce any substantial amount of real revenue because of  
the lapse of time between assessment and payment. Effectively, therefore, any reparations  
payments at all would unbalance the budget again, with the inevitable effect on the mark.

'The prospect,' the British Ambassador informed Lord Curzon, 'is of a somewhat alarming  
character. There has been no real determination to stop the printing press, there is little efficiency  
in the tax-collecting system, and there is very great timidity in putting a stop to doles and  
subventions ... If a really able and powerful Finance Minister could be entrusted with the  
direction of Germany's finance I imagine he would soon put a different aspect on the position.'  
He advanced two desiderata: that any increased direct taxation ought not to synchronise with  
higher prices, and that the taxpayer ought not to realise too clearly the destination of his  
contributions, particularly when they were due to foreign creditors.

For a fortnight, Wirth's government had been undergoing a severe fit of nerves and had been on  
the point of resignation. The straw that was to break it was the announcement on October 17 of  
the League of Nations' decision on the future of Upper Silesia -that the former imperial province  
be partitioned between Germany and Poland. Indignation was universal and acute, as much out  
of national pride as because the loss of another highly important slice of Germany's industrial  
areas would make economic recovery still less likely. The League's decision was one of the  
principal reasons which for years made Germany's own membership impossible. The Chancellor  
was obliged to resign, but October 36 found him back in power again, leading the coalition of  
Majority Socialists and Democrats which accepted, though under protest, the Allied Note which  
delivered the news from Geneva. Meanwhile the mark hit a new low of 600 to the pound.

Dr Wirth was not short of advice about how to carry on. On October 25 the Bavarian state  
Finance Minister, while professing himself not unopposed to reparation payments so far as they  
were possible, warned the Berlin Government in a speech that 'there is a limit to taxation if the  
economic life of the nation is not to be paralysed.' He drew attention to the flood of new revenue  
legislation pouring in upon the tax officials, which (he said) could have produced milliards more  
if the revenue officers had had time to go after the profiteers and others who evaded taxes.

The public were angry, but they were in the main not yet as depressed or pessimistic as the  
politicians. Berlin shops were selling huge quantities of goods to Germans as well as to  
foreigners. Share prices moved upwards as the dollar improved against the mark. The banks were  
so full of stock exchange orders that some were days behind in opening letters in the stock  
departments.

'Of course the rise is unhealthy and feverish,' wrote Lord D'Abernon.

We cannot be very far from a panic. As soon as inflation ceases to increase and deflation sets in,  
there will be the devil to pay. Behrenstrasse here, which corresponds to Lombard Street, reminds  
me of San Francisco after the Earthquake. Almost every bank is being increased or rebuilt, and  
one can hardly get along the roadway. Something like the South Sea Bubble.

It must have been very hard for the ordinary man with little knowledge of finance to determine  
whether the outlook was good or bad. The truth, no doubt, as the Ship of State steamed headlong  
downstream towards the cataract, was that it was good for some and bad for others. At any rate,  
people knew whom to blame if, despite some of the trappings of prosperity, the nation's survival  
was in danger. The Berliner Tageblatt pointed out on November 9, 1921:

We still import more than we export. And yet we must surrender 26 per cent of the gross value of  
our exports \[in reparation payments\]. Foreign countries, frightened by our rivalry, are  
constructing barbed-wire fences. Obligations are forced on us for decades to come, and nothing  
is done to stabilise the mark by any international action. When the \[London\] Ultimatum was  
accepted the dollar was at 60 marks. Today it is 180 or more ...

The newspaper complained of the 'quite small capitalist upper class' making huge profits by  
taking advantage of the exchange fluctuations, while foreigners were using the discrepancy  
between the home and foreign values of the mark 'to purchase our goods en masse'. It demanded  
that profits on exchange and dollar speculations be taxed intensively, and went on:

The tax on corporations produces the minimum revenue because all kinds of expenditure are  
deducted ... including the cost of the private motor cars of the owner or directors and so on ...  
The assessment of all our taxes is so behindhand that hundreds of thousands of the wealthy  
classes have not yet paid their taxes for the year 1930. The whole tax edifice, a house of cards in  
Babel, is tottering. Social democracy demands an immediate visible sacrifice of the producing  
classes in the form of taxation of real values. Industry has sought to parry the thrust by its  
readiness to facilitate the payment of the next gold milliard by a credit action.

More and more astounding estimates were by then circulating in regard both to the amount of  
German banknotes held physically abroad, against what eventuality it was not clear, and the  
amount of German capital deposited or invested or retained abroad in order to escape taxation. A  
newspaper article by Arthur Eichhorn commented authoritatively on the flight of capital,  
observing in the first place that the amount of exported capital was unknown even  
approximately, although it had certainly been extensive since the end of the war:

Evasion of taxation, fear of socialisation, and inflation have combined to drive capital out of  
countries with a depreciated currency into countries where the currency is sound or at a premium

... This has nothing to do with international trade or with normal credit operations, but merely  
increases the chaos of exchange rates.

Dollars, Swiss francs and guilders were the favourite objects in this scramble for conversion, but  
others, including the Czech crown, were coming into favour. The credits in Dutch names in  
Swiss banks were out of all proportion to the trade between Holland and Switzerland, and the  
assumption was that these were 'Swiss credits of German speculation camouflaged as Dutch'. A  
curious side-effect of the rush for Swiss francs was that the market rate for short-term money in  
Switzerland was less than 3 per cent while long-term was at over 10 per cent.

With capital escaping, the budget unbalanceable, and no one wanting to hold marks, the  
inevitable happened; and by the middle of November 1931 a dollar would buy 250 paper marks,  
and a pound sterling 1,040. The mark had sailed past another traumatic milepost in its downward  
progress. Germany now needed to find 500 million gold marks before the end of February to pay  
the Allies, and knew that she faced sanctions by France — the occupation of the Ruhr — in case  
of default. Default would come unless London helped. The London bankers, however, refused to  
give the necessary credits unless Germany put her financial house in order and unless French  
demands became more reasonable. Since no condition could apparently be met without the  
fulfilment of the others as its preconditions, German bankers now began to fear that the mark  
might fall to Austrian levels.

On the face of it, three urgent measures were needed: a balancing of the budget to permit the  
shutting down of the printing presses; the end of subventions to industry made through the  
subsidy of food, the inadequacy of rail freight rates, and the insufficiency of the coal tax (even a  
100 per cent tax would only have brought Germany's cheap coal up to 550 marks a ton, a small  
fraction of the world price); and the revision of customs duties coupled with an efficient system  
of tax collection. Given the power of the industrial lobby, none of these departures looked likely  
or even possible.

The rising cost of living was by now causing considerable industrial unrest in the Ruhr, where  
even the new wage tariffs were failing to keep pace with it. The factory owners loudly held that  
the high prices were the result of a financial blockade by the Entente, of which the partition of  
Upper Silesia was the latest episode. It was special pleading which moved the wage-earner little.  
The British Vice-Consul in Essen reported:

'The present prices of food are liable to be increased still more, assisted by an utter lack of  
organisation from the executive point of view. Although this town has a special office for dealing  
with profiteering, and although each week the punishments meted out are published in the local  
press, comparatively few of the delinquents are adequately punished. For example, a man  
arrested for selling white flour obtained illicitly was tried and imprisoned, but was able to sell the  
flour again on his release ... Not only are prices of incoming commodities increasing daily, but  
the prices of old stocks are increased within the twenty-four hours ...'

On November 22, Sir Basil Blackett\*, (Later a Director of the Bank of England. He joined the  
Treasury in 1904. Born 1882, died 1935.) Controller of Finance at the British Treasury,  
presented the Foreign Office with a sobering memorandum on Germany's problems. He had been

much struck on his tour of inspection by the contrasting positions of Britain with nearly two  
million people out of work and Germany with scarcely any unemployed at all.

In spite of his robust common sense, the man in the \[German\] street is beginning to believe what  
some interested industrialists are telling him, so that he seems almost readily to subscribe to the  
false doctrine that it is good for trade that a government, by inflationary finance, should  
habitually spend more than its income; and that it is necessarily bad for a country to receive a  
large income from abroad 'by way of an indemnity ...

Even the German industrialist knows that the present activity of German industry (destroying the  
export trade of its neighbours) is a sign of fever and not of prosperity. But, as usual, each class in  
Germany thinks that the burden of taxation should fall on some other class or classes ... Even the  
best disposed are inclined in a fatalistic way to let things take their course and wait for the world  
to recover its reason. The big industrialists are attempting to save something from the wreck by  
turning all the paper marks they can into foreign currencies or, failing that, into real things —  
land, machinery, and so on, which have an independent value ... The incentive to saving is gone  
just when saving is of vital necessity to the State.

s

The fall in the mark, the memorandum continued, was gradually-wiping out the middle classes,  
the value of whose investments was quickly disappearing. A holding of 1 million marks in  
German War Loan, which had corresponded at the time of purchase to about £45,000 of British  
War Loan, now had a sterling value of about £1,000, 'and even its internal purchasing power is  
not more than £3,000 and is rapidly falling'. A German pensioner with an income of 10,000  
marks before the war compared favourably with an English pensioner with an income of £500.  
Now, the sterling value of his pension was £10 and its purchasing power less than £30. Insurance  
policies, furthermore, were worth less to the holder or his widow than the annual premium which  
he had put by each year out of his hard-earned savings.

Blackett noted that the rent restriction Acts hit much the same classes, who were 'forced to  
starvation in order to subsidise the German workman's wages and the employer's profits'. The  
bread and rail subsidies, financed by inflation, combined with the rent restriction, enabled the  
foreigner to buy German goods well below world prices and, if he lived in or visited Germany, to  
travel, eat and occupy houses at ridiculously cheap rates. 'A gradual process of buying up and  
carrying off Germany's movable capital, secondhand furniture, pianos, etc., is taking place at the  
expense of Germany as a whole.'

Foreigners were also buying up real property and interests in factories and all kinds of  
businesses. To some extent this was at the expense of the workman whose wages lagged behind  
the climbing cost of living, but it was mainly at the expense of the middle classes whose capital  
was destroyed and largely exported. The exporting industrialists could just keep their heads  
above water, Blackett thought, but the others making goods out of partly imported material could  
not possibly replace it with a continually rapidly falling mark.

The report ended:

The one real temporary advantage is that Germany's workmen are in employ, but even this is  
mainly due not to successful exporting but to the misdirected consumption of holders of paper  
marks who want to get rid of them, and therefore to misdirected production, which actually  
interferes with the proper flow of exports and to some extent increases the amount of luxury  
imports.

That the government has been or is deliberately pursuing a policy of inflation so disastrous for  
any government that adopts it is sufficiently disproved. It is partly weakness and inexperience  
which have prevented greater success.

Blackett's assessment, with which D'Abernon would entirely have agreed, contrasted sharply  
with the French government's belief, or affected belief, that Germany was bluffing, manipulating  
the exchanges to her own advantage, and in reality rapidly increasing her prosperity. In fact, the  
evidence of what was happening to the German economy was ready to hand in the Allied  
occupied zones beside the Rhine.

The British Consul-General in Cologne, Mr Paget Thurstan, writing on November 23, 1921,  
observed that the shops there were daily thronged with crowds of purchasers, and that in self-  
protection many of them were closing their doors for a great part of the day.

It is no uncommon spectacle to see queues of intending purchasers lined outside the shops  
waiting for the doors to reopen. In these circumstances it is evident that retail stocks will soon be  
sold out and replacement of them will cause prices to rise very much higher. Indeed, I understand  
that the unusual phenomenon exists of wholesale prices being now often considerably above  
retail prices, the difference in certain articles being nearly 100 per cent. Clearly, as long as such  
conditions prevail, there can be no limit to the rise in the cost of living as measured in marks, and  
settlements of wages' disputes are merely ephemeral.

Four days later Addison was repeating the same story from Berlin, even though the capital, being  
much further from the frontier, had suffered far less from incursions by foreigners anxious to  
benefit by the exchange rate.

Many shops declare themselves to be sold out. Others close from one to four in the afternoon,  
and most of them refuse to sell more than one article of the same kind to each customer. The rush  
to buy is now practically over as prices on the whole have been raised to meet the new level of  
exchange. In almost every camera shop, however, the sight of a Japanese eagerly purchasing is  
still a common feature. But on the whole, as far as Berlin is concerned, it is the Germans  
themselves who are doing most of the retail buying and laying in stores for fear of a further rise  
in prices or a total depletion of stocks.

Addison then had an interview with the Chancellor who said despondently that the continual, fast  
rise in prices was at last giving immediate concern for the maintenance of public order. Dr Wirth  
said that all reasonable demands would have to be granted, but that the situation was altering  
daily so rapidly for the worse, and the constantly recurring difficulties which demanded redress  
cost so much extra, with no funds available to meet them, that the burden was becoming too  
great for the head of the government to bear.

'The Chancellor is doing his best to keep things quiet,' was Addi-son's opinion,

but the impossibility for the working classes to obtain even obvious necessities except at  
exorbitant prices, coupled with severe winter setting in, might lead to serious trouble. He was  
about to preside over a Cabinet convened to deal with fresh demands for increased wages put  
forward by the municipal employees of Berlin, and we were sitting in a semi-darkness caused by  
a partial strike of electrical workers which was only settled the next day by a promise of  
increases all round, involving an extra expenditure of 400 million marks.

'Dr Wirth,' Addison wound up gloomily, 'is a man of quiet determination with a leaning towards  
optimism.'

Although Addison regarded it as an almost universal German defect to view all difficulties  
through a magnifying glass, he accepted that not only were the middle classes in severe straits  
but that the working classes had lowered their standards to the bearable minimum. Neither he nor  
any of his German contacts were in any doubt that the chief elements which lead to disturbances  
and revolutions were present in Germany once again at the end of 1921. In late November, when  
food riots were taking place in Berlin and having repercussions over much of the country, the  
mark dropped to just over 1,300 to the pound.

They had repercussions too, in Austria, where the fall of the krone was gathering speed, and food  
was even shorter. Hand in hand with the exasperation caused by the continual rise in prices went  
the feeling of intense resentment and hate against all who had made, or were thought to have  
made, money out of Austria's misfortunes -the Schieber, the speculators on the exchange market,  
and inevitably the Jews.

The Viennese rioted on December 2, consequent upon another severe fall in the krone. The  
amount of glass smashed in the city that day was enormous. The unarmed crowd of 30,000,  
many hooligans among them, wrecked and looted food shops, restaurants and cafes everywhere,  
and attacked the hotels in the main quarter. It was only in the case of the Bristol Hotel, however,  
where Sir William Goode, the former president of the Austrian section of the Reparations  
Commission, was staying, that the crowd penetrated as far as the second floor to invade and  
ransack his apartment. According to a report, after Sir William had 'kept the mob for an hour  
from entering a room where several English and American ladies had taken refuge,' he was  
robbed of all his effects.

The demonstrators' demands from the government included the seizure of all foreign currency —  
the medium which most shops in self-defence were insisting upon for purchases — and the State  
control of the securities market. They wanted all gold to be taken into State hands, including that  
which belonged to the churches and monasteries. They called for a progressive property tax, an  
immediate system of child insurance and a systematic reduction of food subsidies. The  
Chancellor gave ground on all these matters except the food subsidies, whose abandonment  
would have raised the apparent cost of living still more.

It had been a day of warning. The British Commercial Attache in Vienna was still able to write,  
as the krone moved relentlessly downwards: 'I fear these disturbances presage collapse.' Until  
stabilisation came, it was of course the one thing any one could be sure of, financially though not  
politically. Indeed, the capacity of the Austrians for long-suffering had proved remarkable.  
Whereas almost any other people in Europe would have exploded time and again long before

now, Austria's reception of a four-year concatenation of financial crises had so far been relatively  
tame. The middle class were by far the hardest hit, and had not taken any effective public action  
to better their position. In fact, the December riots seemed to relieve the feelings of most  
Viennese for the time being. With the krone at more than 2,000 to the pound, Austria quickly  
settled back into her usual state of lethargy. Vienna University closed down for the winter  
because of the cold. The Stock Exchange went on strike because of a tax on its members.  
Railway fares were raised 300 per cent. And while the night-life of the rich grew more and more  
phrenetic, retired barristers and ex-generals could have been found stone-breaking beside the  
Danube.

### 5: The Slide to Hyperinflation

SOCIAL unrest was one of the obvious symptoms of inflation. The disease, the Austrian and  
German financial world seemed to agree, was itself not containable without international  
goodwill and a significant relaxation of the obligations under the peace treaties. Germany's  
politicians therefore set about relieving the symptoms wherever possible. More measures were  
brought in so that the government might be seen publicly to be dealing with profiteering. The  
Prime Minister of Bavaria even submitted a Bill to the Reichsrat to make gluttony a penal  
offence.

For the purposes of the Bill, a glutton was denned as 'one who habitually devotes himself to the  
pleasures of the table to such a degree that he might arouse discontent in view of the distressful  
condition of the population.' It was proposed that such a one 'may be arrested on suspicion, and  
punished by imprisonment and/or a' fine of up to 100,000 marks (about £75) for a first offence.'  
A second outbreak of gluttony was to entail for the offender penal servitude of up to five years,  
fines of up to 200,000 marks, and the deprivation of civil rights. Provision was also made for  
punishing caterers who abetted or connived at the crime, and a special section provided that  
foreigners, on conviction, would be liable to the extra punishment of expulsion from the Reich.\*  
(The Foreign Office document containing this report bears Lord Curzon's scribbled comment  
'Amusing', and a suggestion that it should be sent on to divert the King.)

The Bill — reminiscent of a recent Austrian move to tax anyone who gave a luncheon or a tea  
party — was of little enough importance as it was never enacted. It was indicative, none the less,  
not only of the great offence caused both by German profiteers and by the foreigners swarming  
in to take advantage of the exchange rates, but of the desperate, not to say absurd, lengths to  
which respectable politicians were already being pushed.

In so far as the fall of the mark was due directly or indirectly to the reparation obligations which  
Germany could not possibly meet, it was universally presumed that even temporary alleviation of  
those obligations would send the mark briskly in the opposite direction. A third London  
conference was convened for December 18; and the announcement was taken to mean that the  
Allies had at last appreciated that the gold payments due in January and February 1922 were  
virtually unmeetable. This consideration sent a wave of confidence crashing dangerously back  
through the exchanges — confidence that at last the intolerable blight on the financial system  
would be removed. On December 1, 1921, the mark soared upwards, regaining a quarter of its  
November value. By the time it reached 751 to the pound (against its November average of  
1,041) the paper-mark prices of many stocks and shares, although still well above the levels of  
December 1920, had declined by half or more,\* (e.g. Daimler: (Dec 1920) 295; (Nov. 1921) 800;  
(Dec 22 1921) 490. Allgemeine Elektrizitatsges: 319: 1,100: 657. Deutsche Bank: 327: 701:  
475.) while the Reichsbank was buying foreign currencies heavily.

Mr Seeds reported a similar panic in Munich, where some of the smaller banks and financial  
concerns had been very hardly hit. 'The press have said that the London financial negotiations are  
no ground for a sudden improvement in the rate, and are trying to discourage speculation,' he  
wrote.

But in this respect conditions are hopelessly unhealthy, and the public will continue to be swayed  
by rumours and to speculate either in goods or in stocks and shares.

As regards dealing in shares, all classes of the population have for months been speculating with  
a fine disregard for common-sense. Shares have been freely bought in totally unknown concerns,  
in some cases with the object of exchanging valueless paper money for what was considered a  
good security, but generally in the hope of profiting by a rise in the stocks. Shares in respectable  
concerns which had paid a 20 per cent dividend, say, were pushed higher and higher till the final  
holders could not expect a return of even 1 per cent, with the result that the improvement of the  
mark has brought not satisfaction but the very reverse.

The previous fall in the mark had also produced unfortunate results by driving the population in  
shoals into the shops in a mania of purchasing. While abusing the foreigner for buying out  
Germany with his profitable rate of exchange, the native has been no whit behind in emptying  
the shops of their stocks ... Many thought that their money would soon have no value whatever  
and that it must be exchanged for goods while there was yet time: others realised that the  
purchasing mania would help the falling rate of exchange to raise prices, and they therefore  
bought on speculative grounds.

The press pointed out that a disastrous slump in trade could not but ensue when the purchasing  
power of the population was exhausted, and that meanwhile the poorer classes were suffering.  
All efforts, however, were in vain to drive sense into a panic-stricken people, and articles in the  
shops could be seen being marked up to a higher price day by day.

German currency is of course stigmatised as shoddy paper of no value. Still, it has always been a  
striking fact that the German of the more modest classes has always had sufficient thereof to  
spend on luxuries such as theatres, cinemas, skating rinks, excursions to the country and so forth.  
The amount spent during the craze for buying must have been very large. The explanation —  
usually given is that the money was provided out of capital and savings. Discussing the question  
with me the other day, the Minister of Commerce gave the same explanation and dwelt on what  
he considered the most serious part of this state of affairs, namely that the people's confidence in,  
and loyalty to, the State had been gravely undermined: those who had supported the government  
during the war by buying State bonds had lost heavily by the depreciation of the mark, and the  
whole population were now engaged in evading taxation and devoting their money to speculative  
purchases, either of carpets and the like or of so-called 'securities'.

That the German government was now confronted (in the words of a member of the  
Disarmament Control Commission) with the problem of a whole community of taxpayers  
making, wherever they could, false returns, was bad enough. The growing disillusionment —  
almost universal already, in all conscience — with the government itself, which the Bavarian  
Minister of Commerce had spoken of, made it worse.

'The reins are trailing on the ground,' complained the Berliner Tageblatt on December 6 in a  
leader.

Nobody can say what will become of the whole batch of taxation proposals ... \[because\] the  
Finance Ministry is 'run' by the Food Minister as a sideshow ... More new banknotes were issued

during the last week in November than ever before: 4.5 milliards of marks — practically double  
our entire note circulation before the war. If we do not make up our minds to put our finances in  
order we shall have compulsory administration forced on us by our creditors.

Lord D'Abernon had already reached much the same conclusion about the Chancellor. His diary  
entry for November 24 1921 states, not without conscious humour:

I am increasingly convinced that Wirth understands very little about figures and regards them  
mainly as pegs on which to hang rhetoric. Directly one discusses the details of the German  
budget with him, his attention flags and he seems quite unable to follow even my most lucid  
developments.

It may be that, with others, Dr Wirth at that stage regarded the balancing of the budget as a more  
academic than practical project while France was calling upon Germany, as he put it, 'to lay  
milliards of gold by the sack upon the table'. The Berliner Tageblatt faithfully reported him on  
December 16, saying that he regarded the economic system as something which was artificially  
swollen by the fall in the rate of exchange, which might lead to a very bitter disillusion in the  
course of a few months. 'This fictitious prosperity with which we are often reproached by our  
adversaries,' he said, 'is evident in quite another form in other countries. In England and America  
it takes the form of unemployment ..."

Dr Wirth declared that it was impossible to restore the world, and especially the European,  
economic system when all Eastern Europe lay shattered, and when the incapacity of the peoples  
of Eastern Europe to purchase was spreading to Central European countries. The only cause for  
hope, he thought, was that the world, and 'English haute-finance' in particular, was at last  
heeding Germany's explanations of why she could not pay what was asked, that the London  
Ultimatum had rendered Germany uncreditworthy, and that the problem was minutely related to  
the world economic system.

The press received his speech coldly. An innately law-respecting country which was already  
undergoing outbreaks of plundering by its own population needed action rather than excuses to  
encourage it. Unfortunately, to put its reforms into effect the Socialist government supremely  
depended upon the most reactionary official classes, whose goodwill had dwindled with their  
savings and incomes. The result was that less and less was done, and that the government was  
losing the support of the workers who stopped even bothering to vote. For them, politics were  
becoming irrelevant: at Christmas 1921 the rising cost of living and how to cope with it had  
become their only concern.

In the eight years since 1913, the price of rye bread had risen by 13 times; of beef by 17. Those  
were the commodities which had fared best. Sugar, milk (at 4.40 marks a litre), pork and even  
potatoes (at 1.50 marks a Ib.) had risen between 23 and 28 times; butter had gone up by 33 times.  
These were only the official prices — real prices were often a third higher — and all these prices  
were roughly half as much again as in October, only two months before.

The brief December recovery of the mark brought no relief. That event, which caused  
unemployment transiently to treble to 3 per cent, gave another warning of what would inevitably  
have to be suffered when, one day, the printing presses stopped printing banknotes to order.

Before the war, when the mark was sound, there were normally about 9,500 bankruptcies a year.  
As wartime inflation increased, the number regularly dropped, from 7,739 in 1914, to 807 in

1918.  The total number in 1921, during the first seven months of which the mark was fairly  
    stable, was 2,975, more than double the 1920 figure and three times that of 1919.\* (The annual  
    bankruptcy figures from 1912 were: 9,218, 9,725, 7,739, 4,594, 2,279, 1,240, 807, 1,015, 1,324,  
    2,975.) The 1921 figures were the most indicative; for in comparing the number of bankruptcies  
    during the various months of the year it could be shown that a falling mark was associated with a  
    decline in bankruptcies, and vice-versa. The largest number, 845, was in the spring when the  
    mark stood highest; but after it reached its lowest in November the number was 150. The  
    Frankfurter Zeitung commented: 'It gives some inkling of the awful debacle which may be  
    expected if a rapid and permanent improvement of the mark actually takes place.'

The London conference between Mr Lloyd George and the French Prime Minister, M. Briand,  
came and went and solved nothing. The reparations question was postponed until after the New  
Year, when there was to be a further conference at Cannes. Its principal decision was to grant  
Germany a moratorium on the January and February instalments but to oblige her thereafter,  
pending a new readjustment, to pay 31 million gold marks every ten days. Diplomatically,  
however, the Cannes meeting went dismally. The German delegation headed by Dr Rathenau,  
the Minister of Reconstruction, was snubbed and ignored by the French for the first four days.  
And when M. Briand was seen to be taking instruction on the golf links from Mr Lloyd George,  
he was accused by his French colleagues of being subservient to British policy. He was recalled  
to Paris by President Millerand the day before the conference concluded, and was replaced by M.  
Poincare. Poincare attained office on the simple programme of making Germany pay; or, as he  
put it himself, 'to uphold firmly all France's rights under the Treaty of Versailles'.

'The fees in the Courts of War," wrote Lloyd George, with a fine touch for epigram, 'are all on  
the highest scale.' Germany had lost the action and had to pay the full costs. With Poincare,  
however, the justice had to be not only preventive but retributive. Lloyd George had this to say  
about the French leader of 1922:

He had no use for the Cannes conference. He knew how to get money out of Germany — by the  
lash! ... Briand was a Breton. M. Poincare was a Lorrainer born in a province repeatedly overrun  
by Teutonic hosts ... he himself twice witnessed the occupation of his own cherished home by  
German troops ... He is cold, reserved, rigid, with a mind of unimaginative and ungovernable  
legalism. He has neither humour nor good humour ... He was not concerned about a just, and  
least of all, a magnanimous peace. He wanted to cripple Germany, and render her impotent for  
future aggression ... The fall of M. Briand sent the world rolling towards the catastrophe which  
culminated in 1931.

It rolled, of course, via the collapse of the mark, the disillusion of Germany, the progressive  
raising of world tariffs, and the cessation of trade, to depression and slump, and on to something  
much worse. But Lloyd George was writing only in 1932,\* (The extract is from The Truth about  
Reparations and War-debts, by David Lloyd George, Heinemann.) when the ultimate disaster  
already seemed to have struck Europe, in no small part the consequence of France's refusal to  
allow Germany to recover from the war.

Germany's effort to meet the reparations burden by implementing the taxation proposals of July  
1921, still showed no signs of producing the desired effect. What was wanted, wrote the British  
Commercial Secretary in Berlin, was not a further set of imposts which would not be collected  
and would still further confuse the already labouring fiscal apparatus, but rather a readjustment  
and ruthless application of existing taxes. He thought that strong pressure ought to be brought  
against the wealthy — especially the industrialists — to make them disclose their foreign  
holdings.

How effective such a method might have been was shown by the reaction when, earlier, the  
government proposed to annex a portion of dividends. Sooner than admit this direct participation  
of the State, and in order to avoid any future interference with actual property, the industrialists  
proposed to assist the State by placing a proportion of their foreign holdings and foreign credit at  
its disposal for the payment of the reparation instalments, in return for which a proportion of  
future taxation would be remitted. The manner in which this proposal was made to the  
government (in September 1921) was hardly that of subjects to their sovereign authority, nor of  
the taxed to the tax-gatherer: in fact the industrialists actually made their offer conditional upon  
the transfer of the railways from the State to themselves. The government rightly refused any  
such bargain.

With the Cannes conference over and the prospect of a new and harder French line on reparation  
payments, the mark started to drift downwards again, reaching 850 to the pound in the last week  
of January 1922. One whom Lord D'Abernon's diary described baldly as 'one of the most  
influential men in the country whose name must not be mentioned' compared the country to an  
automobile which could not be stopped in five yards. Everyone recognised, he said, that the  
deflation period was going to be disagreeable, with men out of work and factories closed, and  
that there would have to be a limit fixed to printing notes. But, he added, 'Do not pull us up too  
short. Give the car time to stop without skidding.'

With a government and a commercial world convinced that it would be unwise to do anything in  
the least precipitate, life ground on in a pother of financial worries for all classes. Seeking  
somebody with commercial experience to represent Germany in Washington, Dr Rathenau was  
heard to complain not only that very few business men had diplomatic experience, but that, of  
those who had, all preferred to restore their private fortunes than to enter government service.  
Very few now had considerable private fortunes left, and Herr Cuno for instance, who was to  
become the leader of the Rightist government the following year and who might have done for  
Washington, in the meantime desired to make his financial position secure.

In Bavaria the principal winter apprehensions were that the coming tourist season would see the  
food supplies eaten up by other Germans and foreigners, specially those drawn to the area by the  
Oberammergau Passion play. Measures were being taken to assign the relatively expensive  
imported foodstuffs to the tourists, leaving the home produce for the local population. Berlin  
enjoyed an extensive strike early in February of public employees, which halted the railways as  
well as the usual services. This was something that Berliners were growing used to, and before  
the city's water was cut off consumption was three times the normal as everybody filled up baths  
and every other receptacle to meet the occasion: Moscow was generally blamed for backing the  
workers' agitation with money, and public opinion turned against the Communists.

It was natural that a people in the grip of raging inflation should look about for someone to  
blame. They picked upon other classes, other races, other political parties, other nations. In  
blaming the greed of tourists, or the peasants, or the wage demands of labour, or the selfishness  
of the industrialists and profiteers, or the sharpness of the Jews, or the speculators making  
fortunes in the money markets, they were in large measure still blaming not the disease but the  
symptoms.

It was significant enough that union, demands were still for higher wages to meet rising prices  
rather than, before all else, stable prices and a stable currency. A few of the financially  
sophisticated could be heard blaming the government, and the Finance Minister in particular, but  
a typical view was that prices went up because the foreign exchange went up, that the exchange  
rate went up because of speculation on the Stock Exchange, and that this was obviously the fault  
of the Jews. Although the price of the dollar was a matter for almost universal discussion, it still  
appeared to most Germans that the dollar was going up, not that the mark was falling; that the  
price of food and clothing was being forcibly increased daily, not that the value of money was  
permanently sinking as the flood of paper marks diluted the purchasing power of the number  
already in circulation.

Strangely enough the vision of the Allied Reparations Commission was similarly obfuscated.  
When the rate of exchange fell between February and March, 1922, from 45 to 70 paper marks to  
the gold mark, (or otherwise from 900 to 1,400 to the pound), the commission demanded that the  
German government raise another 60 milliards in new taxes. It did not occur to them to demand a  
restoration of the level of exchange: still less did they see that there was little chance that taxes  
increased to an impossible level could conceivably make good such a depreciation.

Dr Rathenau accounted for the absence of unemployed in Germany by pointing out that a million  
men were working to pay reparations, a million to produce goods to buy food abroad, and  
another million simply to make up the loss of output since the eight-hour day was introduced. He  
did his best to explain to the Reichstag what was happening to the mark by alluding lengthily to  
the vicious circle of an adverse trade balance, the consequent necessity to sell German currency  
abroad, and its resulting depreciation, followed by the fall in the exchange rate and inevitable  
rise of home prices, leading to increased costs of materials and labour and so to new rifts in the  
budget. Dr Rathenau expressly and publicly denied that the printing press had any role to play in  
that permanently spiralling sequence of events, and by ascribing the country's ills primarily to the  
unfavourable trade balance caused by reparation payments he totally failed to understand the  
reality that the country was living far beyond its means, printing money to pay for excesses  
which included over-employment, the inordinate subsidy of industry, the import and  
manufacture of luxuries for domestic consumption, and a grossly inefficient tax-collection  
system.

Most successful businessmen, however, stuck happily to the heresy that only by a continually  
falling exchange rate could Germany compete in neutral markets. After them, the deluge. Neither  
they, nor the politicians, nor the bankers — with distressingly few exceptions — perceived any  
direct connection between inflation and depreciation. And yet, as the printing presses churned  
out bank notes the exchange continued rapidly to fall. What impressed the ordinary politician  
was the danger of social unrest which would, in his opinion, inevitably arise if there were any

scarcity of currency. He could not see, or intentionally ignored, the obvious danger which  
proceeded from continuous inflation. Social unrest appeared, just the same.

During the first three months of 1922 the economic situation became notably worse. The two-  
month moratorium on reparation payments did no more than postpone the January fall of the  
mark until, at the end of February, the first 'ten-day payment' became due. Throughout the whole  
of March the fall went on; and only in April did a rally come, when the European financial  
community, whose willingness to grasp at straws was still amazingly unaffected by frequency of  
disappointment, decided that the international conference billed to begin in Genoa that month  
might bring salvation. The meeting brought an extra-mural crisis which put an unpleasant  
complexion on the five weeks of deliberations — the Treaty of Rapallo signed, after secret  
negotiations, between Germany and Russia who mutually feared that they were being shut out of  
any say in the future of Europe. The Genoa conference over, the prospect of thrice-monthly  
squeezing of Germany's real resources returned.

The second half of 1921 had already brought a 50 per cent increase in the official food prices.  
With that rise the real wages of a single workman had more or less kept pace. The married  
workman, on the other hand, was worse off because of the greater demands upon him for  
clothing and warmth whose costs were rising faster. In practice the prices of most articles  
depended on the luck or skill of the purchaser. According to Mr Seeds, the Consul-General in  
Munich, who required his German chauffeur to keep careful notes of his family expenditure,  
such goods as butter could only be bought at considerably above the nominal cost. Milk in  
Munich, at 4.50 marks a litre in December 1921, rose to 6 marks in March 1922 and to 7 in  
April. Butter at 42 marks a Ib. in December (9 marks above the posted price) could only be had  
for 50 marks in April. Eggs had risen from 2.50 apiece to 3.60; beer from 3 marks a litre to 5.60;  
and the prices of sugar, meat and potatoes had all doubled.

For any whose incomes were failing to keep abreast of, or somewhere close to, increases such as  
these, the tempest was blowing. The Allied blockade was still taking its toll on the young  
generation, its effects now dangerously amplified by inflation-bred poverty. All children of every  
class, according to a study in Ffankfort-on-the-Main in February 1922, were two years physically  
and mentally backward for their ages. It remained difficult for them to recover those lost years  
because milk was obtainable only for the sick during the winter, and the price of bread was  
rising. It was a not uncommon sight to see anxious mothers searching in the dustbins of private  
residences in the richer neighbourhoods in the hope of retrieving scraps of food from the  
garbage.

Those lucky enough to have the monopoly power of an organised trade union to protect them  
were still in the shelter. They faced their employers, the German manufacturers as well as the  
central and local governments, with theoretically crippling wage demands. The employers'  
choice was between granting them or being prepared for wholesale strikes and disorders such as  
had recently been undergone in Britain. In the nine weeks or so after the Rapallo Treaty was  
signed, although the exchange rate was comparatively static at around 1,300 to the pound, the  
cost of food soared upwards. The 50 per cent rise during the second six months of the previous  
year now became a desirable objective, and in Hamburg the price rises monitored for food alone  
in April, May and June were respectively 46 per cent, 51 per cent and 56 per cent.\* (Phillip  
Cagan defined hyper-inflation as beginning in the month in which price rises first exceed 50 per

cent (equivalent to an annual rate of 600 per cent): cf. his essay in Studies in the Quantity Theory  
of Money, edited by Milton Friedman, University of Chicago Press 1956.) For a brief time in  
May when the price of meat doubled in a matter of a month the rise in the cost of living was so  
abrupt and startling that the unions for a space were unable to decide what demands to put  
forward.

In view of the rocketing cost of labour, the eagerness of manufacturers to extend their works,  
renew their plant and embark on large improvement schemes was at first sight somewhat  
extraordinary. From a social point of view, too, so much commercial building was unfortunate in  
a country now short of over a million houses — in part the result of the rent restriction Acts  
which had throttled the private sector of the building industry. But German industrialists had  
been unable to build up liquid reserves which would keep their value, and such cash as they  
could not hold illegally abroad in a foreign currency was generally converted — as Sir Basil  
Blackett had remarked — into real or fixed assets. For that reason an appreciation of the mark  
was greatly feared, and even the few weeks of post-Genoa 'stability' invited stagnation in  
business. Industrial circles were faced with the danger that cash would become more valuable  
than goods, and of a crash when everyone attempted to convert their assets back into money  
again.

A further reason for their viewing any appreciation with dismay was noted in a report by a  
member of the Rhineland High Commission at the end of May. It would have rendered the  
payment of taxes not an academic hardship but a real one. A mark received as income in 1921  
had an actual average value of, say, a penny. A year later when the tax was due on it, it was  
worth a fifth or sixth of that figure — and incomes had increased in the meantime, if not in the  
same proportion, at least very substantially. The longer payment could be postponed, the greater  
the gain could be.

'The big interests believe,' said the report, 'that as the mark is doomed as a currency beyond hope  
of recovery, all efforts to support it are costly, useless, and dangerous to their or, as they put it,  
the country's interests.'

The better German industrial concerns had particular reason for satisfaction with their lot. They  
might look weak financially, but many possessed enormous concealed reserves because their  
debenture shares and other prior-charge debts had been contracted on the basis of the gold mark,  
and gold-mark equivalents of goods and services had been received for them. The mighty  
Stinnes group, for one, was still working on gold capital. The fall in the value of the paper mark,  
however, had written off'98 per cent of the gold debt — to the companies' gain and to the  
shareholders' loss. New borrowings from the Reichsbank, furthermore, from whom commercial  
enterprises could obtain credit at very low discount rates even at the height of the crisis in 1923,  
were automatically written off in the same way: rapid depreciation caused the real value of  
repayments to be smaller than the original loans by whatever factor time and the rate of fall  
dictated.

Hugo Stinnes himself, the richest and most powerful industrialist in Germany, whose empire of  
over one-sixth of the country's industry had been largely built on the advantageous foundation of  
an inflationary economy, paraded a social conscience shamelessly. He justified inflation as the  
means of guaranteeing full employment, not as something desirable but simply as the only

course open to a benevolent government. It was, he maintained, the only way whereby the life of  
the people could be sustained.

The President of the Reichsbank whose industrial interests were negligible did not in essence  
depart from this argument, and in a speech on German currency in May 1922 greatly vexed Lord  
D'Abernon because he had (in the ambassador's words) 'pressed into the shortest space the  
maximum number of fallacies and errors'. As though his powers to wreck the economy were not  
great enough already, at the behest of the Reparations Commission, and in the expectation that  
money supply would thereby be divorced from political expedience, the Reichsbank was that  
same month declared autonomous, with Dr Havenstein its uncrowned king. He quickly showed  
that he, too, considered the fall in the exchange to be quite unconnected with the gigantic  
increases in note issue, and went on 'merrily turned the handle of the printing press completely  
unconscious of its disastrous effect.' There was evidence, D'Abernon believed, that 90 bankers in  
Germany out of every 100 expressed and perhaps held the same views. At any event, the  
financial press reported without dissenting from them.

Ever-climbing wages and the high expenditure plans of the industrialists jaundiced and clouded  
many a foreign eye, notwithstanding the penury that had hit so many. The Times on April 18,  
1922, printed a bitter report from 'a man of business' recently in the country:

The greatest fraudulent conspiracy in the history of the world is now being enacted in Germany  
with the full concurrence and active support of its 60 or 70 millions of people. And this  
conspiracy is brazenly enacted under the very noses of the Allies. Germany is teeming with  
wealth. She is humming like a beehive. The comfort and prosperity of her people absolutely  
astound me. Poverty is practically non-existent. It is all the other way ... And yet this is the  
country that is determined she will not pay her debts ... They are a nation of actors ... If it wasn't  
for the fact that the German is guiltless of humour, one might imagine the whole nation was bent  
on perpetrating an elaborately laborious practical joke ...

Of course prosperity existed for some, and was to be seen on the surface. Those eating well in  
restaurants were those who could afford to eat well in restaurants. As money saved diminished  
like a lump of ice on a summer's day, there was in any case every incentive to eat it, drink it or  
be merry on it. The Bavarian government's gluttony Bill of the previous autumn had drawn in its  
preamble the nice distinction between habitual gluttony and occasional overindulgence on festive  
occasions. The man of business must have overlooked not only the haunts and troubles of the  
poor, just as he would probably have overlooked them at home in Britain: the plight of the  
pensioners and of the rentier classes had escaped him altogether.

In Hamburg where the authorities were particularly concerned to stamp out the iniquities which  
aggravated social distress, the regulations formulated to check profiteering were having only  
moderate success. In the first three months of 1922, the 175 actions brought by the state resulted  
in fines totalling 347,000 marks — by then worth less than £1,500 — and prison sentences  
amounting to 1,635 days. Of these punishments, the highest fine imposed was one of 50,000  
marks for profiteering in flour, and the longest jail sentence a year and nine months for  
profiteering in coal. By June the Wucheramt, the office for the suppression of profiteering, had  
step ped up its activities to deal with the 185 cases reported during the month and collected 1.4  
million marks in fines — now only worth about £1,000 sterling.

Apart from the bigger sentences these figures can have brought small comfort to the Hamburgers  
who in the same month received an average of 105 marks (enough to feed the statistical family  
of four at official prices for only one day) for each of the 200,000-odd articles pledged at the  
municipal pawning establishments; who since April had had to pay 20 times the registered fare  
for their horse cabs and 25 times for their taxis; and whose cost of living, like everyone else's,  
was now rising by not less than half every four weeks.

In the spring of 1922, Germany was evincing many signs of national despair. It was apparent to  
most that under the Imperial dispensation the nation had at least been confident as well as  
prosperous. What was disturbing at any rate to the older generations of the upper and middle  
classes was their realisation of the superficiality of Prussian culture. Younger people, some of  
whom later remembered those years not as a nightmare but as an adventure, were mainly  
confused and disillusioned. The self-confidence of the country ebbed away along with its  
prosperity, and as it did so the moral degeneration of the nation and its institutions set in.  
Pessimism and restlessness grew as sense of security, community spirit and patriotism dwindled.  
Neither the hatred of French militarism in the abstract and of France in general, nor a growing  
desire for revenge, were enough to hold together what had been the most law-abiding people in  
Europe when the very fabric of that nation was crumbling along with its ethical values, and when  
the moral, material and social ravages of inflation were undermining and immeasurably  
worsening the condition of both.

Among some, it was true, the rebirth of the German soul, battered by the war, hardship and  
humiliation, was becoming something of an obsession. Not just the militarists of  
Frontklimpfertag and the academics of Konigsberg but many of all classes who were victims of  
inflation began to long for a great leader: not a ruler (thought one contemporary observer) of the  
type of the Kaiser or of Tirpitz, but one possessed of the attributes and Spartan values of the  
legendary figures of early Teutonic history. It was a longing which Hitler, with his attraction to  
Wagner, fully understood, and one which his NSDAP was already exploiting in Munich. When a  
nation is falling apart, its old values challenged by new conditions, there are always elements  
who will seize on any means of cohesion.

'Inflation finished the process of moral decay which the war had started', Erna von Pustau told  
Pearl Buck.

It was a slow process over a decade or more; so slow that really it smelled of a slow death ... In  
between were times when the mark seemed to stop devaluating, and each time we people got a  
bit hopeful. People would say 'The worst seems over now'. In such a time Mother sold her  
\[tenanted\] houses. It looked as though she had made a good business deal, for she got twice as  
much cash as she had paid. But the furniture she bought ... had gone up five times in price and  
... the worst was not over. Soon inflation started again with new vigour, and swallowed bit by bit  
the savings accounts of Mother and millions of others.

Frau von Pustau explained that one house was sold because the couple living there had had both  
sons killed in the war, had no one to care for them, had had their life savings devalued, and so  
had gassed themselves. 'Our times,' she went on, 'made us cynical. The pie was growing smaller  
and more people wanted to have pieces of the pie, and so there was nothing left from the "good  
Neighbour" atmosphere of former days. Everybody saw an enemy in everybody else.' Her father

complained that 'we of the middle class are not organised against the wholesalers, while the  
workers are organised against us.' The middle classes, in other words, were being squeezed  
between the two big classes of big business and the workers.

In the summer of 1922 the small businessman saw his enemy in the big businessman, personified  
by Herr Stinnes, 'the greatest obstacle to currency reform', as Lord D'Abernon described him.  
The Right, now intriguing in Berlin for the return of the Hohen-zollerns and in Munich for the  
return of the Wittelsbachs, saw its enemy in the Republican government. More ominously, it saw  
treachery in the policy of fulfilment of the reparation debt personified by Dr Rathenau. Neither  
Rathenau nor Stinnes trusted the other, but perhaps they came nearest to mutual comprehension  
in the early morning of June 28 on the way home from a late evening of argument about coal  
deliveries to the Entente at the American Ambassador's house in Berlin. Rathenau, a Jew like  
Erzberger, had just undergone, like Erzberger, a vitriolic attack in the Reichstag from the  
Rightist leader Dr Helfferich.

A few hours later, as Rathenau was driven from his home to the Foreign Office, the path of his  
car was blocked deliberately by another, while two assassins in a third car which had been  
following riddled him with bullets at close range. A bomb, thrown into his car for good measure,  
nearly cut his body in two.

### 6: Summer of '22

The murder of the apostle of 'fulfilment', a statesman whose cosmopolitan approach transcended  
the narrowness of nationalism, burst the dam and sent the mark skidding off the plateau it had  
occupied since the beginning of April. The currency once more collapsed — a word which must  
serve again although it scarcely permits adequate description of what was to come — from 1,300  
to 1,600 to the pound at once, and within a week to 2,200, nearly 500 to the dollar.

Not Rathenau's death alone, celebrated as it was by a general strike in Berlin as a warning to the  
Right, lay behind the latest fall. In Bavaria, for example, the state finances were already in a  
hopeless condition because of the incapacity of the revenue officials to deal with the  
overwhelming arrears of tax, and because the estimated deficit for 1922 had doubled. Although  
reduction of expenditure was as easy to preach and as difficult to carry out in Bavaria as  
anywhere else in the world, the continued steep decline in the purchasing power of the currency  
made things vastly more difficult. In June 1922, the authorities had not yet dealt with the Federal  
taxes for 1920 — an echo of the central government's own difficulties. (A measure of the  
Bavarian Landtag's grasp of the situation was its decision, notwithstanding these conditions, to  
double the annual subsidy for encouraging gymnastics).

There were external factors, too. Negotiations (through the Morgan Committee) to arrange  
further international loans in Paris had failed, against expectations and hopes, and the ability of  
the financial authorities to ward off sudden movements in the money markets ceased. The  
Frankfurter Zeitung on July 7 noted that the fear of internal disturbance in Germany seemed to  
have caused a panic, the larger industrial companies starting it with heavy buying of foreign bills  
in order to safeguard future supplies of raw materials. For the first time since the Armistice, the  
newspaper remarked, appalled, foreign countries had refused Germany a loan which until then  
had been obtainable by selling paper marks abroad: 'The mark for the moment is unsaleable.'

A new development was the rapidity with which prices now moved after the exchange rate. Until  
the early summer there had been a considerable interval between the depreciation of the mark at  
home and abroad. Just before the post-Rathenau collapse an increasing number of industries  
were declaring that their costs of production were reaching world market levels, so that they  
could no longer compete abroad. This development, needless to say, puzzled those who observed  
that the cost of labour remained cheaper in Germany and that other industrial subsidies continued  
as before. Far from having unemployment, it was pointed out, there was actually a labour  
famine, for one reason because many German labourers were seeking higher wages in Belgium,  
Holland and even in the border areas of France.

In the spring of 1922 a growing divergence had been evident between the rate of increase in the  
floating debt arid that of the volume of money in circulation. Behind this lay, first, the inability  
of private banks any longer to advance the loans needed to keep industry and commerce going;  
and, second, the corresponding liberality with which the Reichsbank conceived it its duty to fill  
the gap. From the summer onwards, commercial bills were dealt with as generously as Treasury  
bills, and the loans available to business were at far more indulgent rates than the private banks  
could possibly have offered. The discount rate for these commercial bills remained at 6 per cent  
throughout August while during the same month the mark fell by 250 per cent against the pound.

Within six months commercial bills were approaching three-fifths of the Bank's holding of  
Treasury bills. The demand for extra credit which the Reichsbank's behaviour stimulated was  
scarcely less critical in promoting inflation than its profligate bounty towards the government  
itself.

The most notable thing about the pu">lement of the financial world, not least the writers of the  
Frankfurter Zeitung, was the complete failure to consider the continuing flood of new banknotes  
as one of the reasons for the mark's behaviour. Its latest fall was reckoned disastrous for the  
finances both of the Reich and of the regional governments: all efforts to restore order in the  
federal budget had been rendered void. It meant the further impoverishment of the classes on  
fixed incomes, state officials included, and (as another newspaper feared) further recruits for the  
radical circles of the Right from these 'social declasses'.

'Grave feeling of disquiet here,' wrote D'Abernon in Berlin in his diary entry for July 10, 1922.

The whole sky is overcast and gloomy. The fall of the mark continues — today it is 2,430, or  
about half the price of a month ago. Prices are rising and will soon be double the level of June 1,  
wages and salaries must be adjusted. Adjusted to what?

The financial position in Germany, he noted, was precisely that in Vienna a year ago, with the  
exchange between 2,000 and 2,500. 'Today exchange in Vienna is about 95,000. Will Berlin a  
year hence be at this level?'

Lord D'Abernon blamed the German authorities as much as anyone else for what was happening.  
He considered their recklessness with note issues the blindest folly — 'it requires handcuffs', he  
wrote 'to stay the hand which turns the crank of the printing press'. However, unpromising as  
things were, it was found that the activities of the Reparations Commission could usually be  
relied on in those days to eliminate the slenderest hope that confidence would return. Their very  
presence in Berlin produced panic. 'The moment they appear,' said Lord D'Abernon, 'the mark  
bolts.'

While the commission's Committee of Guarantees visited Berlin in September 1921, the mark  
had fallen from 350 to 650 to the pound. Now, during their extended midsummer visit it had  
plunged from 1,800 to 2,400, and the German government had been happy to remind them of  
that fact: six weeks of expenses, including that of their special railway carriage which waited in  
Berlin throughout that time, were paid in ao-mark notes, which required seven office-boys with  
huge waste-paper baskets to carry to the railway station. Meanwhile, the commission's insistence  
on making the Reichsbank independent of government control (implemented in May 1922) had  
turned out, in the British Ambassador's view, to have been like giving maniacs the control of the  
asylum:

'Last week', stated his July 10 diary entry, 'when by the blessing of Providence, the printers  
struck and the printing of notes was perforce interrupted, Havenstein brought in strike-breakers  
to get the presses going again.'

There was more behind the printers' strike than D'Abernon's brief account. An extraordinary  
amount of paper money had been needed in June, causing the Reichsbank to issue 11,300  
milliard marks in new notes. Owing to strikes, the usual inflow of these notes back into the bank

had not happened, so that there were none in reserve. About six months before, according to a  
confidential memorandum given to the Chancellor, contracts were awarded for the supply of a  
special new paper which made practicable the quick printing of notes bearing a simple imprint  
which could not be imitated. The paper arrived at the printing offices unexpectedly on July 7. It  
should have been possible to print enough 500-mark notes by July 13, a Thursday, in time for  
delivery on pay day. In spite of the readiness of the trade unions to go ahead with the new paper,  
the printers themselves suddenly withdrew their consent.

'It was plain,' said the memorandum, 'that other forces were at work than a mere wage or  
sympathy strike. It seemed probable that hidden and illicit leaders were trying to seize the State  
by the throat.'

'If on the half-monthly pay day for many of the great industrial works no money was  
forthcoming, the government would be faced with the danger of popular disturbances. Before  
making its decision to break the strike, the government was also faced with the danger of the  
Berlin strikers' destroying the machinery if volunteers were taken on.

The British Consul at Frankfort-on-the-Main reported in late July that there had been an  
instantaneous rise in the price of the necessaries of life. The workman's wage had naturally been  
raised in proportion, and a skilled workman was now demanding 100,000 marks a year —  
£5,000 a year in pre-war money, but by then worth necessaries of life. The workman's wage had  
naturally been raised on the same basis. 'Such rates,' said the consul, 'leave the professional man,  
the doctor, the teacher and the bank clerk far behind in their capacity as wage earners: a trained  
bank clerk, for instance, can only aspire to a maximum yearly salary of 12,000 marks' — or  
about £5 if changed in London.

In the four weeks of July the index for the wholesale prices of 98 varieties of food had risen from  
9,000 points to 14,000, another monthly rise of well over 50 per cent. The Frankfurter Zeitung  
recorded that the wholesale price of 'goods' had gone up by 139 times since before the war; of  
leather and textiles by 219 times. Against these figures, the American index representing world  
prices, with a fall in cereal prices since before the war and an increase in metal, had remained  
steady. The Communist newspaper Rote Fahne (whose statistical material was also generally  
accurate) reckoned that at that date the 'minimum of existence for a four-person family', in  
Germany, had increased since 1914 by 86 times while the average wage had increased only 34  
times. An egg which had once cost 4 pfennigs now cost 7.20 marks, a 180-fold increase. In the  
course of the first week of July alone, the four-person-family weekly minimum (a little more  
than £1 in London terms, or $5 in New York) rose from 2,300 to 2,800 marks. A bank clerk's  
annual salary would therefore keep his family alive for about a month.

The Austrian situation was thus being relentlessly reproduced in Germany, with the more  
educated classes, deprived in most cases of the right decently to live and bring up their families,  
becoming more and more hostile to the Republic and receptive to the forces of reaction. The  
consul in Frankfort reported a virulent growth of anti-Semitism.

It is no exaggeration to say that cultured German men and women of high social standing openly  
advocate the political murder of Jews as a legitimate weapon of defence. They admit, it is true,  
that the murder of Rathenau was of doubtful advantage ... but they say there are others who must

go so that Germany shall be saved. Even in Frankfort, with a prepondering Jewish population,  
the movement is so strong that Jews of social standing are being asked to resign their  
appointments on the boards of companies ...

Erna von Pustau recalled the same trend in Hamburg, where 'stock exchange' and 'Jews' were  
ideas very much connected in the minds of the people, and where the circumstances of a  
situation which no one really understood made those who had lost their savings or their fortunes  
ready prey for anti-Semitic propaganda. Her father began to speak against the Jews more and  
more, asserting now that 'creative capital is the capital we Germans have: parasitical capital is the  
capital of the Jews.'

'You should have known my father as he used to be,' she told her friend.

The political education I had I got from him. He explained to me things against the Kaiser, and  
our Parliament. But now he has stopped thinking and reasoning, and this will do more damage to  
us than it will ever damage the Jews. ...

At what might otherwise have been the height of the immediate crisis at the end of July 1922, the  
Reparations Commission decided to take its summer holidays, effectively postponing any  
settlement of the exchange turmoil until mid-August; and M. Poincare, bent as ever (it was  
believed) on Germany's destruction, sent a Note to Berlin accusing the government of wilful  
default on its debts, and threatening 'retortion'. The effect on the financial situation was  
calamitous. The rise in prices intensified the demand for currency, both by the State and by other  
employers. Private banks could not meet the demand at all, and had to ration the cashing of  
cheques, so that uncashed cheques remained frozen while their purchasing power drained away.  
It became impossible to persuade anyone to accept any description of cheque for that reason, and  
much business quickly came to a standstill. The panic spread to the working classes when they  
realised that their wages were simply not available.

Because the Reichsbank's printing presses and note-distribution arrangements were insufficient  
for the situation, a law was passed permitting, under licence and against the deposit of  
appropriate assets, the issue of emergency money tokens, or Notgeld, by state and local  
authorities and by industrial concerns when and where the Reichsbank could not satisfy  
employers' needs for wage-payment. The law's purpose was principally to regularise and regulate  
a practice which had gone on extensively for some years already, with the difference that  
authorised Notgeld would now have the Reichsbank's guarantee behind it. Before long, as that  
guarantee became increasingly less esteemed, the tide of emergency money that now entered  
local circulation, with or without the Bank's approval, contrived enormously to raise the level of  
the sea of paper by which the country was engulfed. As the ability to print money privately in a  
time of accelerating inflation made possible private profits only limited by people's willingness  
to accept it, the process merely banked up the inflationary fire to ensure a still bigger blaze later  
on.

Because of the excessive rise in the cost of living in these weeks, ever more pressing demands  
for higher wages flowed in from all classes with any leverage on their paymasters. Strikes  
accompanied those demands. A strike of shop employees in Frankfort on August 8 resulted two  
days later in a wage increase from 7,200 to 9,600 marks a month backdated to the beginning of

July. It was followed at once by a compositors' strike, which closed down the newspapers for  
two weeks and then produced a settlement which promised a weekly wage increase of 500 marks  
effective until September 1, after which it would rise to 800 marks until September 16, at which  
point the results of further negotiations would apply. Government officials were awarded a 38  
per cent increase from August 1, and government workers an additional 12 marks an hour — a  
further burden on the budget of 125 milliard paper marks. There were no plans to meet this  
burden beyond a 50 per cent increase in rail freight charges from September 1 and another  
increase in the postal rates (the face values of new postage stamp issues which in 1916 had  
ranged from the 2-pfennig grey to the 4-mark red and black, in late 1922 started at the 50-mark  
blue and went up to the 100,000-mark red).

Mr Seeds wrote from Munich to say that his chauffeur's weekly expenditure on food was now 5  
times as great as it had been a year ago, in August 1921. On the other hand, his wages were  
nearly six times higher. Since these were fixed according to the average rate paid to his class of  
worker, he was not suffering unduly except in so far as wage rises, a monthly occurrence by this  
time, always lagged a little behind price rises which took place weekly, if not daily. This was the  
case for the vast mass of artisans and workmen, but of course, Seeds said, the middle class,  
including officials and journalists, were far from being in the same satisfactory position. It was  
from this latter group, he pointed out, that foreigners mostly derived their information, which  
was why the accounts of the incidence of inflation published abroad were almost unrelievedly  
gloomy.

The young Ernest Hemingway, however, working for the Toronto Daily Star, crossed the frontier  
from France at about that time and managed to be equally gloomy from the other side of the  
fence:

There were no marks to be had in Strasbourg, the mounting exchange had cleaned the bankers  
out days ago, so we changed some French money in the railway station at Kehl. For 10 francs I  
received 670 marks. Ten francs amounted to about 90 cents in Canadian money. That 90 cents  
lasted Mrs Hemingway and me for a day of heavy spending and at the end of the day we had 120  
marks left!

Our first purchase was from a fruit stand ... We picked out five very good looking apples and  
gave the old woman a 50-mark note. She gave us back 38 marks in change. A very nice looking,  
white bearded old gentleman saw us buy the apples and raised his hat.

'Pardon me, sir, he said, rather timidly, in German, 'how much were the apples?'

I counted the change and told him 12 marks.

He smiled and shook his head. 'I can't pay it. It is too much."

He went up the street walking very much as white bearded old gentlemen of the old regime walk  
in all countries, but he had looked very longingly at the apples. I wish I had offered him some.  
Twelve marks, on that day, amounted to a little under 2 cents. The old man, whose life savings  
were probably, as most of the non-profiteer classes are, invested in German pre-war and war  
bonds, could not afford a 12 mark expenditure. He is the type of the people whose incomes do  
not increase with the falling purchasing value of the mark and the krone.

Hemingway recorded that with the mark at 800 to the dollar, or 8 to the cent, a pound of coffee  
could be had for 34 marks. Beer was 10 marks a stein, or one cent and a quarter. Kehl's best hotel  
served a five-course meal for 150 marks, or 15 cents.

The French cannot come over to buy up all the cheap goods they would like to. But they can  
come over and eat ... This miracle of exchange makes a swinish spectacle where the youth of the  
town of Strasbourg crowd into the German pastry shop to eat themselves sick, and gorge on  
fluffy, cream-filled slices of German cake at 5 marks the slice. The contents of a pastry shop are  
swept clear in half an hour ...

The proprietor and his helper were surly and didn't seem particularly happy when all the cakes  
were sold. The mark was falling faster than they could bake.

Meanwhile out in the street a funny little train jolted by, carrying the workmen with their dinner-  
pails home to the outskirts of the town, profiteers' motorcars tore by raising a cloud of dust that  
settled over the trees and the fronts of all the buildings, and inside the pastry shop young French  
hoodlums swallowed their last sticky cakes and French mothers wiped the sticky mouths of their  
children. It gave you a new aspect on exchange.

As the last of the afternoon tea-ers and pastry eaters went Strasbourg-wards across the bridge the  
first of the exchange pirates coming over to raid Kehl for cheap dinners began to arrive.

The mark plummeted downwards. Dr Wirth, dining with Lord D'Abernon on August 16 said that  
that day, when the mark had fallen to below 1,000 to the dollar compared to its par price of about  
5, had been one of the worst in the history of Germany and also one of the worst in his  
experience. He had been inundated with visitors, many of them in a state of semi-panic about the  
financial crisis and with all kinds of unworkable or impracticable solutions to the country's  
difficulties.

The Chancellor would accept no connection between printing money and its depreciation.  
Indeed, it remained largely unrecognised in Cabinet, bank, parliament or press. The Vossische  
Zeitung of August 16 declared that

the opinion that the flood of paper is the real origin of the depreciation is not only wrong but  
dangerously wrong ... Both private and public statistics have long shown that for the last two  
years the interior depreciation of the mark is due to the depreciation of the rate of exchange ... It  
should be remembered today that our paper circulation, although it shows on paper a terrifying  
array of milliards, is really not excessively high ... We have no 'dangerous flood of paper' but, on  
the contrary, our total circulation is at least three or four times as small as in peace time.

Lord D'Abernon described these remarkable views as 'far from exceptionally retrograde', and in  
fact typical of enlightened Berlin opinion. The Berliner Borsen Courier a couple of days later  
showed greater concern for the social consequences but no more awareness about the reasons. It  
regretted that the German mark at one-three-hundredth of its par value was now in the same class  
as the Hungarian korona. The proletariate was becoming restless, said the newspaper, and the  
State whose taxation estimates were based on an average exchange rate of 500 to the dollar was  
helpless.

But the real tragedy of the depreciation may be described as 'the moral effect'. An apparently  
endless fall in the value of the mark predicted abroad will cause at home an unbearable increase  
of uncertainty. No economic discussions will pacify the masses, or hide from them the price of  
bread.

It has long been realised that the printing of notes is the result and not the cause of depreciation,  
and that the amount of currency, as it increases in bulk, is really decreasing in value. A point has  
now been reached where the lack of money has a worse effect than the depreciation itself ...  
Even should the quantity of paper money be three times its present size, it would constitute no  
real obstacle to stabilisation.

Until such a time, therefore, let us print notes!

It was clear to this leading financial daily what was happening: that as the total of paper marks in  
circulation had risen from 35 milliards in December 1919 to 200 milliards in July 1922, the  
equivalent sterling value had fallen from £193 million to £83 million. Before the war the  
currency circulation of 6 milliard marks had been worth about £300 million. The cause, however,  
was still a matter for firmly asserted conjecture.

Dr Hummel, the young but influential State President of Baden, stated that he, for one, would not  
like to take responsibility for halting the presses. He attributed the fall in the mark variously to  
moral and psychological causes, the posturing of Poincare, and the burden of reparations as well  
as to the note-printing. Doubtless they were all contributory factors; and D'Abernon himself  
likened Poincare's attitude to a teacher constantly rapping a pupil on the knuckles without  
realising that he was moribund. Yet the catastrophe of Austria was an object lesson for all to see.  
'A continued panic in the mark is probable,' the ambassador wrote, 'unless the immediate cause  
of its fall — i.e. the continuous outpouring of notes from the printing press — is stopped. It will  
require a surgical operation to get this into the heads of authorities here: nothing short of  
trepanning will do it.'

On August 24, more strained than ever, Dr Wirth was telling the ambassador about his fears that  
Germany would be unable to find enough food to feed people during the coming winter, least of  
all while reparation payments went on. As they were talking, D'Abernon recorded, 'a card was  
brought in giving the dollar exchange at 1,837 an enormous fall since yesterday.'

The confusion of the people and the government in the face of such total lack of certainty in  
financial matters was echoed at diplomatic levels. A fine instance found its way into D'Abernon's  
diary on August 26:

Met the American Ambassador this afternoon, who said, 'I know a great many things; how much  
do you know?' But I could not get out of him what the deuce it was. He said, 'We are almost at  
war'; but whether he meant America and England, or France and Germany, or some other  
complication, I have no idea.

### 7: The Hapsburg Inheritance

UNQUESTIONABLY the post-war years had brought about a remarkable redistribution of  
wealth and income in Austria. The main problem it gave rise to was that an excessive proportion  
— that received by the working classes — now escaped taxation. It was beyond the wit of the  
government to find a means of taxing wages which the workers would not be able at once to pass  
on to the employers (especially when the employer was the State or the Vienna municipality),  
which the employers would not pass on to the consumer, and which would not then be passed  
round again to the printing press in consequence of the increases in wages and prices which  
mechanically followed. An alarming picture both of national selfishness bred by inflation and  
political ineptitude bred by economic uncertainty was painted by Mr O. S. Phillpotts\* (Owen  
Phillpotts was a man with long experience of the country, having been Vice-Consul, then  
Consul, in Vienna from 1906 to 1914.) the Commercial Secretary at the British Legation in  
Vienna:

The Austrians are like men on a ship who cannot manage it, and are continually signalling for  
help. While waiting, however, most of them begin to cut rafts, each for himself, out of the sides  
and decks. The ship has not yet sunk despite the leaks so caused, and those who have acquired  
stores of wood in this way may use them to cook their food, while the more seamanlike look on  
cold and hungry. The population lack courage and energy as well as patriotism. During the  
recent railway strike the authorities applied to an automobile club for volunteers, but none came  
forward; and to a local firm for the loan of lorries, but these were refused unless the government  
would buy them.

For all Lord D'Abernon's concern that the mark would soon be at Austrian levels of exchange,  
therefore, the collapse of the krone was still magnificently outperforming it. May 1921 had seen  
the krone reach 2,000 to the pound. May 1922 found it at 35,000. The root causes were much the  
same as they had always been, supported by international doubts and led by a public domestic  
pessimism which drove the Austrians to purchase all they could with all the cash they had, and  
their determination, despite the harsher penalties recently imposed, to hoard all the food  
obtainable. Shopkeepers had recently been obliged by a new edict to accept the State's  
banknotes; but since it also permitted the continued use of foreign currency for all purchases,  
tradesmen generally found excuses for accepting little else. The move led to considerable  
aggravation as every shop in Vienna was crowded, the peasants trooping in thousands to the old  
imperial capital to rid themselves of their money.

'Women bought in stocks of sugar, coffee, and other goods against a rise in prices, or spent their  
money on clothes and furniture,' wrote V. W. Germains.\* (Author of Austria of Today,  
Macmillan 1932)

Others squandered money recklessly; wine would be dearer tomorrow! On days when the dollar  
rose there would be a run on the shops. Prices would rise from hour to hour; the public was  
seized with a mania for buying. Stories are told of an old bachelor who bought swaddling clothes  
because the local shop had nothing else to sell ... Shopkeepers countered by closing their shops  
on various pretexts, on account of illness, family affairs, stocktaking.

There were those, too, from the towns especially, with no spare money to squander.

In the middle of May 1922 Dr Schober's gallant, almost single-handed efforts as Chancellor to  
bring order to Austria's economy and moderation and common-sense to her politics came to an  
end. His administration was defeated in parliament a bare four weeks after he had persuaded the  
Allies at Genoa to relinquish their prior mortgage rights on all Austrian State property held to  
meet occupation and reparation costs — an agreement which cleared the way for raising an  
Austrian loan. The politicians may have felt that Schober had served his turn, but the dismissal of  
the country's strongest statesman immediately sprinkled question-marks over the country's  
creditworthiness so long as she controlled her own finances. With the news of the ex-police  
chief's resignation the British credit promised by Lloyd George ran out, that from France and  
Italy never materialised, and the krone began to slip away again. Austria's condition stayed  
particularly critical, in contrast to that of Hungary or Germany, because of her heavy dependence  
upon foreign imports.

After June 1 the graph of the krone's fall became vertiginous. The June 5 figure of 52,000 to the  
pound, well over 10,000 to the dollar, produced something of a panic which contributed during  
the next two days to a further fall of 40 per cent. On June 9 the pound was at 70,000 kronen, the  
dollar at more than 15,000. Within a month of Rathenau's assassination in Germany at the end of  
June, the krone dived in sympathy with the mark from 100,000 to 125,000. In parallel with the  
fall came huge price increases, the index whose base had been 100 in July 1921 reaching 2,645.

The Viennese politicians' competence to deal with such a situation had become merely a bad  
joke in the capital, while outside it contempt for and dislike of the central government increased  
still further. In Styria and the Tyrol union with Italy was widely canvassed as the better  
alternative. In Vienna talk of Anschluss with Germany continued, encouraged by the Pan-  
Germans, forbidden as it was by the peace treaties and disparaged as it now was by Berlin - 'Who  
would want to join us,' Dr Wirth asked, 'with the mark in the condition it is?' The League of  
Nations Council refused the necessary permission, and Communist subversion of the country  
increased, with more finance from Moscow.

In fact the Austrian Communist Party itself was as completely and hopelessly bankrupt as the  
country, but Moscow thought it worthwhile supporting because of its relations with Germany's  
more significant movement. It was well organised and, apart from protests against rising prices  
and routine appeals to confiscate the wealth of the rich, interested itself successfully in either  
provoking or extending strikes. A notable development was that, far from being the covert  
organisation of heretofore, individual Communists had begun to show their allegiance and their  
hands quite openly.

In August 1922 a new, despairing plea was sent by Dr Ignaz Seipel, Schober's successor as  
Chancellor, requesting from the Entente a loan of £15 million. In the name of the Supreme  
Council Lloyd George refused it, regretting that Austria since the war had 'already received so  
much from them with such disappointing results'. Austria was cuttingly referred to the League of  
Nations, and by the end of the month the krone had fallen to 350,000 to the pound, exactly one-  
tenth of its value in May. Despair was complete. The Austrians waited for the sky to fall as  
though it had not already done so a dozen times. The chief of police publicly announced that he  
had 20,000 men he could count upon to disarm the dangerously Left-wing Austrian army. The

American minister in Vienna warned visitors not on business to stay away. Frequent as were  
strikes and demonstrations, greater disorders were prophesied, and 'timid Jewish businessmen'  
were reported by the British Legation to be hastening to get their passports in order. The risks of  
plundering by hungry, workless mobs daily grew, for since July the cost of living index had  
increased by 124 per cent. In July alone the State could only meet its liabilities to its employees  
of 150 milliard kronen by paying in instalments. The August increase raised the obligation to 344  
milliards, and the national wage figure for the month was about 700 milliards - in any case, far  
more than the existing circulation. The collapse of all governmental authority was imminent.

The situation of course reflected Austria's basic financial problem of her excessive expenditure  
on superfluous official salaries and wages (the number of whose recipients had greatly inflated  
during the war years) which, as they rose automatically on the index, could only be met by  
printing more money. The trade unions by the end of July were protesting that the index,  
adjusted monthly on the basis of the rise in the cost of living for the previous month, no longer  
sufficed to keep pace with prices; so that the pressures to print more were constantly growing. In  
August alone, the extra issue of uncovered banknotes was 560 milliards - a sum which helped to  
make nonsense of the Act passed in July to set up a new bank of issue with a capital of 800  
milliards supplied half by a forced loan and half by new taxation. Though encouraged by the  
Reparations Commission, the scheme was stillborn simply because the scale of the depreciation  
made it out of date.

With July's crash of the krone a substitute Bourse, the Devisen-zentrale, was set in motion in  
Vienna, a means of regulating transactions and movements in foreign currency which Germany  
and Hungary both emulated within a couple of months. Not only did it fail to stay the rout. It  
could not bring back that critical £18 million worth of Austrian gold now reckoned to be lodged  
in Switzerland. It did not alleviate the harassing conditions of the Austrian middle classes, nor  
the terrible life of the lower. Neither, for that matter, did it have any noticeable effect on the  
operations of the speculators, the deprivations of the profiteers, or on the process of the  
devaluation of the currency. As the krone became unacceptable and unaccepted, those with  
foreign banknotes, the main medium of exchange, began to refuse to part with them at all. The  
Austrians were back where the war had left them, a few million bankrupt, hungry people  
floundering about on a map they did not recognise.

Austria, however, barely afloat as a nation on the tumultuous European seas of 1922 (nautical  
metaphors suited her condition very well), was suddenly to find ground beneath her feet.  
Refusing to await supinely the approach of ruin, Dr Seipel at last resolved to trade part of his  
country's independence in return for its survival at all. 'Now was seen,' said one commentator,  
'the hitherto unparalleled spectacle of an Austrian Chancellor touring Europe offering his country  
to the highest bidder.'

Seipel's tour embraced each of Austria's neighbours in turn, and was a subtle diplomatic prelude  
to his moving appeal made to the League of Nations in Geneva in early September. To this body  
he demonstrated conclusively that without financial help the Austria established by the Treaty of  
St Germain would fall to bits; and he announced that Vienna was prepared to accept whatever  
degree of discipline the League might require in putting her house in order. The pistol at the  
League's head was less the horror of Austrian disintegration than the threat of an Austrian  
customs union, not to mention some politically stronger entity, with one or other of her

neighbours — Germany, Bavaria, Italy, or the Danube States — which was speedily becoming  
the only other viable solution of any kind. That Austria might become an Italian protectorate,  
part of a Greater Italy, gave France particular cause to think twice.

The entire position changed miraculously as negotiations with the League began. The krone  
which reached its nadir on August 25 rose a little, from 350,000 to 335,000 to the pound, in the  
first week of September — and there, helped by the confidence which the talks engendered, the  
government managed to hold it. The Geneva Protocols were prepared within a month. One  
guaranteed Austria's political and territorial integrity; a second provided for Britain, France, Italy  
and Czechoslovakia to underwrite an Austrian' loan of 650 million gold kronen; and a third  
pledged Austria to put her finances straight, to cease discounting Treasury bills, and to set up a  
new bank of issue. The whole was to be guaranteed by investing absolute financial power in a  
Commissioner-General appointed by the League.

After Austria's price index reached its maximum on September 15, 1922, prices fell continuously  
until the end of the year, losing 20 per cent in that time. More remarkably, after September 2, the  
value of the krone against the dollar never fluctuated again, despite the fact that the inflation of  
the money supply continued for another two-and-a-half months and the note circulation more  
than trebled. Until mid-November when the new Austrian National Bank was set up and the  
proceeds came through from a short-term internal loan loyally subscribed by Austria's bankers,  
the deficit on State expenditure was covered by the printing press. Living on credit inspired by  
the hopes aroused in Geneva, the government was walking the thinnest of tightropes.

The post-stabilisation inflation, an oxymoronic situation noted with interest by economists of the  
period, sprang from the need to replace with krone-notes the large number of foreign banknotes  
in circulation. There was also a genuine shortage of cash which the printing press had physically  
been unable to make good: in August 1922 the amount circulating represented a little more than  
80 million gold crowns, compared with the 500 million which had circulated before the war  
(albeit under somewhat different circumstances) in the same area. Two factors contributed to the  
lowering of prices: that they no longer had to be exorbitant to ensure profitability; and that since  
the market for goods had been saturated during an extended spending spree prices naturally fell  
with demand.

After the middle of November when the success of the operation was becoming evident to all at  
home and abroad, the government's policy was primarily to prevent any improvement in the  
value of the krone. Vienna had already witnessed the distressing effect on Czechoslovakia when  
her finances had been rudely deranged by speculative buying of the Czech crown in Germany.  
Austria by 192 2 "had become so geared to continuous depreciation that stabilisation alone was  
enough to create an acute economic crisis. The government's need was for kronen; and these  
were issued against the foreign currency received from either domestic or foreign sources, the  
foreign currency going to swell the bank's reserves. The bank was in fact obliged to buy more  
foreign notes than it needed.

The speed with which confidence and stability, although no degree of prosperity, were restored  
in Vienna indicated the extent to which Austria's particular problem had been mainly  
psychological and administrative. The population of Austria from the beginning had always  
shown a profound distrust in themselves and in their government, and an equally childlike

reliance on foreign help and control. In large measure this was perhaps because the void of  
traditional authority which the revolution had swept away, creating simultaneous disenchantment  
among the impoverished official and ruling classes, remained lamentably unfilled.

Dr Seipel, needless to say, came under the strongest attack from his political opponents for  
having bartered for gold the sovereignty of the new Republic; but the Socialists were finally  
silenced in mid-October by Mussolini's coup in Italy, which raised for them the bogey of a  
fascist Austria if the League loan did not go through: fascismo was currently a popular cause  
among many Austrians. The League finance committee, however, understood at once that no  
Austrian government would be strong enough in parliament to effect the kind of economies  
necessary or to extricate the country unassisted from difficulties which ranged from the promise  
of anarchy to the threat of famine. The short-term internal loan which established the new bank  
was followed at once by a short-term international loan which more and more countries hurried  
to guarantee; and Austria settled down to wait for the long-term international credits which were  
still under discussion. Dr Zimmermann,\* (Dr A. R. Zimmermann, formerly the Burgomaster of  
Rotterdam.) the League's Commissioner-General, arrived in Vienna in the middle of December  
1922, and began at once to create and maintain the economic conditions which the Geneva  
Protocols demanded, recognising how much Austria by herself had already done in stabilising  
the currency to make that task easier.

The priority was to set in reverse a system which, based on a mixture of political expedience and  
Socialist benevolence, was the negation of economics. Vienna was found to contain more State  
employees as a capital of a Republic of six-and-a-half million persons than as the capital of a  
monarchy of 50 million. Tax collection was entirely ineffective, and all State enterprises ran at a  
huge loss. The railway deficit of .£6 million a year, one third of the national shortfall, arose not  
only from overmanning but from undercharging. Each mile of railway had three man to operate  
it against two in Switzerland; and while railway employees' wages had risen with the cost of  
living index, rail tariffs were at one-fifth of what they should have been to supply the  
corresponding revenue. Ministries, railways, the post office — all needed drastic pruning and  
reformation. The subsidies paid out were of startling munificence. Less than half the users of the  
railways paid the full fare. This bankrupt country was even supplying cigars to the population at  
far below the cost of production.

However, alone of the former Central Powers, Austria's finances were now plainly on the mend.  
As public confidence returned despite the soaring unemployment, some of the great quantity of  
hoarded foreign currency flowed back into the market. Here at last was a base on which the  
country could build; or rather, as the independence on outside assistance had to be so vast, on  
which a country could be built.

By the spring of 1922 in the scale of financial and commercial disorder, Hungary, the other rump  
of the Dual Monarchy of the Hapsburgs\*\*, (Hungary had lost all her best territory under the  
Treaty of Trianon, keeping only 14 comitats out of 64. In the British Foreign Office itself it was  
admitted squarely although not publicly that 'reparations on top of that are a bit much'.) was  
midway between Germany and Austria. As an agrarian country, her problems were different  
from either, for she possessed in theory enough to live on and something to spare. Considering  
her fundamentally promising physical condition, it was remarkable how faithfully Hungary  
followed the same path as her former allies towards financial disaster.

Between 1913 and the end of 1921, the currency in circulation increased by 64 times. An average  
number of domestic articles purchased in 1914 for 100 korona now cost 8,260. Before the war, in  
the area which constituted the new Hungary, State revenue had been about one tenth greater than  
expenditure: three years after the Armistice, expenditure was one-third higher than revenue. By  
1921 the dislocation of normal monetary standards resulting from war, revolution, counter-  
revolution, Red Terror then White Terror, and at last Admiral Horthy's regency had brought  
about so great a feeling of despondency that the usual thought of anyone with money was to  
convert it into more stable assets — foreign currency, industrial stock, antiques or jewellery. As  
in Germany and Austria, speculation on the Stock Exchange was rife in every class, with all  
categories of share bought and sold, and the rate of various currencies eagerly watched from day  
to day.

The Finance Minister, Dr Hegedus, openly regarded it as his first task in 1921 to stop the flight  
from the korona. Although it was at 2,100 to the pound in January, he would, he claimed,  
stabilise it at 400. As a matter of fact, six weeks after the Emperor Karl's first attempt to regain  
the throne of Hungary in April 1921, the rate against the pound was brought as low as 800. The  
Hegedus reforms, however, might have been better spread over a decade than over nine months,  
and were so draconian as eventually to lead to his resignation in September. The 29 finance Bills  
passed by the National Assembly during his regime included a 20 per cent levy on capital and  
fierce fiscal attacks on 'war fortunes', shares, luxuries of all sorts, and property — Bills which  
were greeted with consternation or joy according to who was affected by them. A grave  
psychological mistake was committed by the embargo on the removing of 20 per cent of bank  
deposits, because the public, especially the peasants, thereafter became averse to confiding their  
savings to any financial institutions and hoarded them at home to the consequent dearth of  
currency.

Dr Hegedüs ascribed his failure to the fall of the German mark, to the poor harvest, and to the  
uncertainty about reparations. But his last act was to secure a vote of 960 million krone  
(£600,000) to increase the salaries of civil servants which had fallen far behind ordinary  
labourers 'wages; and this measure became the official reason for the new inflation and the new  
depreciation as the printing presses started up again in earnest for the first time since March.

Dr Hegedüs's financial policy had affected Hungarian trade in a textbook manner. As the korona  
appreciated in the spring of 1921, unemployment, till then negligible, grew markedly because the  
goods and raw materials purchased when the overseas rate of the korona was at 2,000 to the  
pound could not be disposed of except at great loss when it improved to 800. As the korona  
improved, in other words, the position of merchants and manufacturers worsened; and when  
Hegedus resigned and the korona fell a sigh of relief rose from the commercial world and work  
was restored to the industrial workless. On the other hand, the temporary rise had been  
profoundly welcomed by the official classes and others on fixed incomes. By contrast, the  
peasantry (two-thirds of the population) on the whole viewed it all with indifference as they were  
always able to sell their produce at something close to the world market price: possibly they were  
better off than any similar body in Europe.

In the last months of 1921 the government had to face again the survival problems of the official  
classes. Supplying them with food and other necessities at less than the cost price produced only  
slight alleviation. A high official such as an under-secretary of State, for example, still received

his pre-war salary of 2,000 korona a month, sufficient in pre-war terms for a life of moderate  
luxury and enough to let him bring up and educate his family. Although aided now with  
subsidies worth 3,000 korona a month, he could not even exist on less than 20,000. This last  
sum, bringing in the equivalent of £120 a year in September 1921 (just before Karl's second  
attempt on Budapest), was worth less than £70 a year by Christmas. Clerical work, also  
remunerated at a fraction of pre-war rates, left its practitioners correspondingly miserable.

Mr Hohler,\* the British High Commissioner in Budapest reported

Later Sir Thomas Hohler, born 1871, died 1946.

Under such circumstances one could scarcely be surprised were bribery rampant: and it says  
much for the Hungarian civil servants that cases of officials being corrupted are comparatively  
speaking rare. The official and cultured classes are by far the worst off. Reticence prevents  
ascertaining what proportion is actually in need. The sale rooms, however, indicate the straits to  
which so many are reduced.

Even so, many of the 'official' class, especially its younger members, were finding outlets for  
their feelings in the mischievous activities of the secret societies, most of which were violently  
anti-Semetic. These societies attracted support, too, from the younger Army officers who also  
needed a cause to work for and someone to blame for their poverty.

In June 1922 the days had passed when a Finance Minister might have brought order to the  
Hungarian budget. Since January the note issue had increased by 28 per cent, the price index by  
36 per cent, and the external depreciation of the korona by between 52 and 75 per cent — the  
spread representing the disparity within a single June week. In mid-June a pound would buy  
4,500 korona, a reflection, stated the new Finance Minister, Dr Kallay, of the financial state of  
Germany and Austria. As in Germany, it was not supposed that the printing press had much to do  
with the rate of depreciation, the orthodox financial circles blaming the 'lack of confidence in  
Zurich' and asserting that as the depreciation was so much greater than the increase in the note  
issue, the latter could at most be a contributory factor to the former. Again, the fact that for many  
months depreciation abroad consistently preceded rather than followed fresh issues of currency  
led Hungary's financial authorities to overlook the effect on Zurich of the knowledge that the  
budgetary deficit would always be made good with paper, and that notes would always be issued  
to satisfy the demand for currency which followed every increase in prices. In any event, no  
more than the German did the Hungarian government suppose that stabilisation was possible  
while the reparations debt remained unknown. The circulation had doubled in the year since the  
Treaty of Trianon was at long last ratified.

At the end of June 1922 appreciable unrest was brewing and the number of cost-of-living  
protests growing. Strikes by Budapest's 'municipal scavengers' and sewage-pumpers were bought  
off in the general round of wage increases granted at rates between 12 and 75 per cent. Dr Kallay  
professed himself irresistibly driven towards increasing the issues of paper money, whatever its  
dangers, so long as no break was in prospect in the spiral of rising prices and increased wages.  
Accordingly the korona which reached 6,000 to the pound on July 17 went to 7,000 a week later  
(it had already fallen substantially in sympathy with the mark after Rathenau's death), and the  
price of food moved up in step. New wage demands arrived at once.

The greater part of the nation's wealth, in the meantime, was being produced by the farming  
community whose taxes, despite the efforts of Dr Hegedüs, were the same in money terms as  
before the war, which was to say less than one-two-hundredth in real terms. This fiscal inequity  
would alone have been enough to intensify the enmity between urban, industrial and commercial  
circles on the one hand and the farmers and property owners on the other. However, the going  
financial opportunities encouraged the farmer to hold back his crops for as long as possible in  
order to create an un-satisfiable demand for them and a further increase in the average price.  
Hungary's doom was largely self-created.

The devaluation of the korona continued with alarming rapidity. September, when the note  
circulation rose by 25 per cent over the August figure and the korona dropped to 11,000 to the  
pound, found the Finance Ministry explaining that the latest banknote increases should not cause  
any depreciation because they merely reflected the increase in the country's assets with the  
gathering of the harvest; and that the currency newly issued would itself be gathered in as soon  
as the annual crop was distributed. Whether it sprang from cant or wishful thinking, the hope was  
vain, for it was not possible to move the harvest at the price.

In some panic the government set up an office for the control of foreign exchange — a  
Devisenzentrale on the Austrian model — in order to ward off financial disaster. While what  
were called its 'Kinderkrankheiten', its teething troubles, persisted it made the situation greatly  
worse. Having fixed a rate of exchange for the korona below its market value and being thus  
unable to induce the holders of foreign currency to part with it, the office found itself without the  
means to help merchants to pay their foreign creditors. Previously traders had sold overseas on  
the basis of the exchange rate for the day, covering immediately in their creditors' currency.  
Under the new regulations each application for foreign money came before a badly organised  
office, and was delayed as much as two weeks — after which because of the shortage only a  
proportion of the application could be granted. Foreign trade therefore quickly slowed down, and  
this led to more unemployment.

By November, on the other hand, with the korona held artificially steady at 12,000 to the pound,  
Hungary's Devisenzentrale was working smoothly enough, and speculators were reported to be  
disgusted with it since the opportunity had gone of rigging the korona's price abroad. Exchange  
speculation had immediately given way to Stock Exchange speculation and a wild stampede to  
buy industrial shares. Shares quoted at 8,000 korona in the spring soared to 100,000 and more;  
and companies seeing their chance began to increase their capital and water their stock. The  
public went on spending; and it was remarked that even conservative investors had no idea of  
retaining their new holdings (whose dividends were ridiculously small in relation to the outlay)  
but rather of making a profit and selling out at the expense of their less astute compatriots.  
However, two months of an almost steady currency, combined with the preventive laws against  
exchange speculation, thereafter forced speculators to realise their share holdings. Quotations  
began to fall again, and many were badly bitten.

The watching public, too poor to gamble, can have had little heart to rejoice at that spectacle.  
Although the korona was firm, prices went on rising, adding 60 per cent in the two months  
before November 1. On November 13 the government raised rail fares and freight charges  
substantially, a move which had direct and fierce consequences for prices in general. 'All  
classes', wrote Hohler, 'have completely lost any sense of proportion so far as costs are

concerned. A Hungarian who merely shrugs his shoulders and murmurs something about the  
Treaty of Trianon when charged 5,000 kronen for a bottle of vin mousseux is exasperated by a  
rise of 5 kronen in the price of tram tickets.'

Hohler provided the Foreign Office with a detailed break-down of how the Hungarians were  
reacting to their new financial burdens. State officials, he said, had been extremely hard hit,  
unable to strike, and kept alive only because their still meagre salaries were supplemented by  
certain privileges such as nominal rail fares and the right to buy some of their needs cheaply.  
Even so, it was 'difficult to understand how those of them unable illicitly to profiler de I'occasion  
manage to exist'. Army officers were scarcely better off. A major, for example, who was paid  
575 korona a week before the war now received 17,000 a week (or about £1 los), whereas he  
would need 184,000 a week to regain his former spending power. In real terms a lieutenant was  
obliged to make do with one pound a week and a corps commander with about £2 55. Married  
officers received a wife and child allowance of 3,500 korona a month (6s) per head.

Except for the lucky few who had capital in neutral countries, the rentier classes presented 'a  
most distressing picture'. The younger and the active had found work, but the older were  
destitute. The professional classes, the doctors and the lawyers, as in Germany and Austria were  
suffering from a shortage of patients and clients, but could adjust their charges to some extent —  
although the medical profession was not helped by all hospitals' having been denuded of the  
most elementary and necessary appointments from beds to bedpans. Professional men on fixed  
salaries had been 'reduced to absolute penury'. Clerks, who formed a highly important class in  
the capital had entirely inadequate salaries ranging from 12,000 to 20,000 a month (a rate  
between £12 and £19 a year), shrinking all the time; but most could still get their luncheons for a  
nominal figure, supplied by their offices, so that body and soul could just be kept together.  
However, for those with families to feed 'the 60 per cent rise in prices for this class does not bear  
dwelling upon'.

Workers with trade unions to support them were, as usual, not so badly off, their pay being  
revised from time to time. Nevertheless they were not exactly fortunate. Whereas in 1914 it  
required 80 hours of work to buy a suit of clothes and in 1919 141 hours, by July 1922 381 hours  
were needed. Similarly, the hours required to buy a dozen eggs had moved from one to three, and  
for a kilo of bread from half to two.

In the countryside the landowners and farmers were less affected than anyone, producing most of  
their own essentials and putting up commodity prices as regularly as the shopkeepers. Landless  
peasants were not doing so well, and the large number of casual labourers whose wanderings had  
been limited by the new confines of Hungary formed a particularly destitute class. Hohler's  
account concluded with the comment that many were thriving in the economic crisis and were  
responsible for the superficial atmosphere of prosperity which Budapest presented — notably, he  
thought, the Jews who made up much of the capital's population.

It was clear as Christmas 1922 approached and as prices rose beyond the power of most of the  
urban classes to cope that the crisis could not be long delayed, nor support for the korona  
usefully continued. With the secret organisations growing in power, extreme nationalism  
burgeoning, and anti-Semitism in evidence even in official circles, Hungary was near the brink.

### 8: Autumn Paper-chase

ONLY the country people were surviving in Germany in any comfort: anyone who lived off the  
land had the readiest access to real values. It was not surprising that even when they ensured that  
the money receipts for their goods were no more than equivalent in purchasing power to what  
they were used to, they were accused of extortion — the more so if they delayed the sales of  
produce in the full knowledge that prices would be higher the longer they waited. Erna von  
Pustau went to stay in the country and asked her hosts bluntly what they were doing with all the  
money they were squeezing out of the townspeople. They replied candidly that they were paying  
off their mortgages. The principle of Mark gleich Mark had helped agriculture enormously: for  
the country people, landowners, farmers or peasants, life had started again. At the end of August  
1922 when the mark passed 2,000 to the dollar — 9,000 to the pound — a mortgage of seven or  
eight years' standing had been 399/4OOths paid off. When Frau von Pustau returned home the  
talk in the family was about prices going up, about the credits which had to be reduced, about the  
middle-class party, about big business and the workers who always asked for more ... The  
contrast between country and city was so enormous that it cannot be understood by people who  
have not lived through it.

Herr Hans-Georg von der Osten, who had formerly flown with Baron von Richthofen's Flying  
Circus and was later for a short time Goering's ADC until he shot the Reichsmarschall's favourite  
stag, recollects that in February 1922, with a loan from a friendly banker, he bought an estate  
neighbouring his own property in Pomerania for 4 million marks (then equivalent to about  
£4,500). He paid the debt in the autumn with the sale of less than half the crop of one of his  
potato fields. In June of the same year, when prices were shooting up ahead of the mark, he  
bought 100 tons of maize from a dealer for 8 million marks (then about £5,000). A week later,  
before it was even delivered, he sold the whole load back to the same dealer for double the  
amount, making 8 million marks without raising a finger. 'With this sum', he said, 'I furnished the  
mansion house of my new estate with antique furniture, bought three guns, six suits, and three of  
the most expensive pairs of shoes in Berlin -and then spent eight days there on the town.'

This was simple commerce: the only thing to do with cash by that time was to turn it into  
something else as quickly as possible. To save was folly. Undoubtedly, however, as in Austria,  
there were many farmers who behaved outrageously. Dr Schacht's account of the inflationary  
years recalled that farmers 'used their paper marks to purchase as quickly as possible all kinds of  
useful machinery and furniture — and many useless things as well. That was the period in which  
grand and upright pianos were to be found in the most unmusical households.' Anyone who was  
alive to the realities of inflation, he said, could safeguard himself against losses in paper currency  
by buying assets which would maintain their value: houses, real estate, manufactured goods, raw  
materials and so forth.

Wholesale recourse to real values enabled not only the well-to-do but also, and especially, the  
unscrupulous to preserve and even possibly to increase their assets ... As a result of this struggle  
for self-enrichment and financial self-preservation, based on exploitation of the ignorance of the  
masses, every aspect of business life was vitiated.

To condemn the individual's struggle for survival in such chaotic circumstances as either selfish,  
or unnatural, or wrong, was in many ways unjust. When people do not understand what is  
happening, or why it is happening, and have no idea about what to do about it, and are not told,  
panic must follow. Even so, that the countrypeople were behaving naturally brought no comfort  
to townspeople who had no goods to barter, and whose incomes remained static.

A Hesse professor lamented as September came that professors, teachers and men of science  
were no longer given the right to live, and many would probably die in the coming winter for  
lack of food and warmth. He feared that their sons, instead of following their fathers' careers, as  
they had done for generations past, would by force of circumstances turn to manual labour to  
earn their bread.

It was obviously possible to be over-pessimistic: earning bread by manual labour over a critical  
period need not bind one permanently to that activity. Yet the professor's complaints showed the  
despondency to which the academic world had been reduced:

Labour, wholly or partially educated labour, has already begun to rule in Germany, and there is  
no demand for brains: that is to say, brains have no longer a marketable value. The result can  
only be a catastrophe for Germany and the downfall of civilisation in central Europe if not,  
indeed, the whole world ...

Already, however, a new element had joined the economic crisis. For the first time the wages  
paid for labour began to lag behind the rise in prices, noticeably and seriously, in spite of  
everything the monopoly of the unions could do about it. President Ebert, pleading with Curzon  
to engineer a further moratorium on reparations, pointed out that the conditions of existence for  
the working population had become 'completely impossible', and that the downfall of Germany's  
economic life was imminent.

A litre of milk, which had cost 7 marks in April 1922 and 16 in August, by mid-September cost  
26 marks. Beer had climbed from 5.60 marks a litre to 18, to 30. A single egg, 3.60 in April, now  
cost 9 marks. In only nine months, Mr Seeds's chauffeur's weekly bill for an identical food  
basket had risen from 370 marks to 2,615.

The rise of nearly 100 per cent within the last four weeks \[reported the consul\] has proceeded by  
such sudden leaps and bounds that no scheme for a simultaneous increase in wages can well be  
devised to cope with it: an increase of wages granted at the end of one week would not meet the  
rise in prices by the following Tuesday for instance, and the working and salaried classes have  
suffered severely despite their continually increasing remuneration ... The wage situation is  
hopelessly dislocated at present.

On September 9 the financial authorities announced that in the previous ten days 23 milliard  
marks had been printed and distributed, representing 10 per cent of the total circulation of paper  
in the country. 'The daily production of the Federal printing press,' the newspapers dutifully  
recorded, 'has now risen to 2.6 milliards of paper marks. In the course of this month it will be  
increased to almost 4 milliards of paper marks, at which figure it is hoped the shortage of money  
will be definitely overcome.'

Shortage of liquid cash, indeed, was acute, and the July emergency money law was coming into  
its own. Large industrial concerns began to pay their workmen partly in notes and partly in  
coupons of their own, which were accepted by local tradesmen on the understanding that they  
would be redeemed within a very short time. Municipalities, too, started to issue their own  
currencies, aware that any delay in receiving their pay packets would dangerously aggravate  
workers whose main concern was to spend them before they depreciated. The cities and towns  
developed a parallel fear of unemployment which on a large scale might lead to outbreaks of  
Communist-inspired disorder, and so began artificially to create employment for their staff. The  
citizens of Frankfort noted with alarm that large tracts of quite serviceable road were being  
repaired outside the town and that the overhead system of telephone wires was being converted  
into an underground one.

The Reichsbank's September plans were duly fulfilled, but as by the second week in October the  
mark seemed to be entering a state of free fall, having moved from 9,000 to 13,000 to the pound  
in six weeks, the hopes that the demand for ready money would be met were as speedily dashed.  
Professor Keynes's prediction 15 months earlier that the mark would fall by a point a day until it  
reached 1,000 to the pound had been out by a factor of 13 in less than two-thirds of the time. He  
now wrote in the Manchester Guardian of September 29 that 2 milliard gold marks a year (£100  
million) was the maximum that Germany could be expected to pay in reparations, that beyond  
that sum was to be 'in the realm of phantasy', and that there could be no certainty that even that  
amount could be paid. He described France's demand of over 3 milliards a year as based on the  
'fallacy, which deceives many Frenchmen, that the extremity of France's need enlarges  
Germany's capacity,' In the meantime, however, Keynes, who was promptly invited with other  
independent experts to Germany to advise on measures to arrest the mark's fall, considered a  
'breathing space' was essential before payments were resumed in even a modest way.

Albert Einstein, too, had views on the reparation problem as the fundamental cause of the mark's  
illness, and forwarded to Lord Haldane an article from the Berliner Tageblatt suggesting that  
Britain and France participate in German industry to the extent of 30 per cent of the share capital.  
Einstein, who desired Haldane to arrange 'so that my name shall not be given publicity in  
connection with this matter' considered it a happy solution.

Alas for everyone's hopes. Einstein's recommendation bore no fruit; and when in November the  
experts' report was published, suggesting a sensible programme of monetary stabilisation (at  
about 14,000 to the pound), budgetary equilibrium, foreign loans, and temporary relief from  
reparation charges, it too was totally ignored by debtor and creditor alike. There was, it is true, a  
good deal else to preoccupy them. In Britain that October Lloyd George's coalition government  
was displaced by a Conservative administration under Bonar Law. In Italy, Mussolini staged his  
coup.

At home in Germany, where people were resorting to trade by barter and progressively turning to  
foreign currencies as the only reliable medium of exchange, new Orders were brought in relating  
to the purchase of foreign bills and the use of foreign exchange to settle inland payments. In  
addition to imprisonment, fines could now be imposed of up to ten times the amount of an illegal  
deal. Further to prevent the flight of capital, its transfer from then on had to be authorised — not  
just notified — and the transactions of importers were to be closely regulated. These moves,  
unfortunately, apart from making legitimate trade more difficult, took no account of the fact that

speculation could still be pursued in foreign stock exchanges, and were thus unlikely to prevent  
the mark's downward course.

In Oldenburg in an attempt to offer a safe investment to the public as an alternative to foreign  
currency 'rye bills' (Roggenmarks) were issued by the state bank, due for repayment in 1927. The  
issue price was the current value of 125 kilograms of rye, and repayment was to be in line with  
the average price of 150 kilograms of rye in the first quarter of the later year, the extra 25  
kilograms representing four years' interest. The bills were bearer bonds, complete with stock  
exchange quotations and secured by the bank's total funds.

In the meantime, September's 26-mark litre of milk became October's 50-mark litre. Butter at 50  
marks a pound in April could be had for 480. In two months the price of an egg had doubled to  
14 marks. A pocket comb cost 2,000 marks.; a pot of honey 8,000; a pair of child's trousers  
5,000; a dozen kitchen plates 7,500; a pair of silk stockings 16,500; a roll of lavatory paper  
2,000; a pair of children's shoes 2,800. Three masses for a relation, however, were still available  
at the old price of 150.

The deputies in the Bavarian Landtag vied with one another, irrespective of their political colour,  
in urging the central government to send relief for the state's poor, hundreds of thousands of  
whom, it seemed, were threatened with starvation. Their plight was made the more poignant with  
the arrival of the Oktoberfest, Munich's great annual three-week fair at which gargantuan  
quantities of beer and pork are consumed — and are sold at very high prices at the best of times.  
As the mark dropped away from 9,000 to 12,000 to 18,000 to the pound, as beer rose from 30  
marks a litre to 78, merrymakers from the countryside, celebrating their harvest, became the  
objects of political denunciation in place of the tourists who had mostly gone home. Mr Seeds  
commented in the Munich consulate:

The deputies are thoroughly justified in speaking of the excesses of the fair with bitter  
condemnation, but a foreign observer who noticed that the thousands and thousands of revellers  
were composed solely of the working and lower middle classes, would be justified in doubting  
the existence of the much advertised starving population. Except where certain sections of the  
middle classes are concerned, it is difficult to resist the feeling that the food subsidies are merely  
a means of passing on to the taxpayer a portion of the wages which should be paid by the  
industrialists.

Stinnes himself, that eponym of capitalist ruthlessness, at a meeting with British businessmen in  
Cologne in November 1922 was asked how long Germany's industrialists were prepared to see  
this state of affairs go on. He replied that they would try to carry on as long as they could — 'if  
necessary until the day after the French government makes up its mind to pursue a policy of  
understanding.' Stinnes was apt to seize any opportunity to drive a wedge between France and  
Britain, but probably genuinely regarded as secondary importance to the risk of unemployment  
the actual point to which the mark might sink. 'With a central government without power or  
authority, with acute economic distress, and with revengeful neighbours ready to fish in troubled  
waters,' he asserted, 'we will do everything in our power to keep our workmen employed.'

Sure enough, in the Ruhr, numerous factories were using various devices to avoid having to put  
men out on the streets. Bochumer Verein, in Essen, for example, engaged 1,500 men making

stock articles for railways although there was no immediate requirement for them. Such  
measures, however, were only possible for firms with big financial reserves, and small firms  
were already dismissing workers in small numbers. With the November price increases -butter at  
800 marks a lb., eggs at 22 marks each — shops were also cutting down on assistants because  
sales were dropping off.

The disparity between the rise in the cost of living and the rise in wages had now become very  
marked. Whereas since the war the former had gone up by about 1,500 times, the wages of the  
miner — in November 1922 the best paid worker — had gone up by barely 200 times. With the  
mark in mid-November at 27,000 to the pound and 6,400 to the dollar, and with prices following  
the course of both with unfailing regularity, not only were wages in general failing to keep pace  
but the workers were not even being paid what was their due. Owing to the shortage of paper  
money of all kinds, federal currency or Not geld, they were finding that by the time the balance  
was paid it had lost 50 per cent of its value. The best-paid workers were unable to purchase the  
barest necessities of life. The others and — as ever — those on fixed incomes or dependent on  
savings suffered accordingly.

That suffering was acute and, although worse was to come, was only the culmination of many  
months of increasing misery. Conditions in Berlin may not have been typical of every urban  
community in the country, but were at least indicative of the general distress. The figures issued  
by the chief burgomaster of Pankow for 1922 showed that nearly 25 per cent of the children  
leaving school were below the normal spread of weights and heights, and 30 per cent were unfit  
to work for reasons of health. In Schoneberg, where in 1913 8 per cent of school leavers had  
been tubercular, the figure was 15 per cent. 'Want,' said the burgomaster's report, 'is gradually  
strangling every feeling for neatness, cleanness, and\* decency, leaving room only for thoughts of  
the fight with hunger and cold.'

The failure of wages to keep pace with prices, and the consequent impoverishment of even the  
most fortunate workers, had a direct effect upon the trade unions. Owing to the tumbling value of  
union funds and the impossibility in such hard times of raising subscription, ordinary strikes  
became less and less practicable. Union leaders, by the same token, became less able to extract  
and deliver the higher wages which the workers and their situation demanded, and so lost first  
their influence and then — although they would not admit it — their control. In an increasingly  
nervous state, they were finding it necessary to make repeated appeals to their members to  
maintain discipline and abide by union decisions.

The workers, on the other hand, became easily roused by extremist factions, and were liable to  
get out of hand and start rioting, especially when they believed that the greatest achievement of  
the Revolution, the eight-hour day, was under attack from the big industrials. Since there were  
many local authorities who would not have hesitated to fire on a rioting mob, the mixture was  
unusually volatile. In the third week of November, there were serious collisions between the  
police and a crowd of angry workers after the employees at the Mannesmann works demanded a  
100 per cent wage increase and tried unsuccessfully — though with Communist encouragement  
— to declare a general strike in the city. A similar manifestation occurred in Cologne. In  
Dresden there was a fierce outbreak against the cost of living, with provision shops looted and  
damage estimated at 100 million marks; and a noisy display of xenophobia before the principal  
hotels which habitually housed the foreigners whose presence in the country was popularly

supposed to be the cause of the rise in prices. In Braunschweig there were food riots and shop-  
plundering, and more food riots in Berlin. Most of these were controllable, but all were  
symptomatic of general distress and unrest.

The gold value of the money in circulation, equivalent to nearly £300 million before the war, and  
to £83 million in July 1922, had by November fallen to £20 million. The more notes were  
printed, the lower the value fell — illustrating the Copernican thesis expounded by King  
Sigismund of Poland in 1526 that 'money loses its value when it has become too much  
multiplied.' How the business of the country could be carried on with so small an amount of real  
currency mystified many observers, and accounted for the ever-mounting pressures on the bank  
to go on printing. That trade continued notwithstanding was usually explained by reference to the  
accelerating velocity with which money circulated. Notes were held for as short a time as  
possible. Private-account cheques were hardly accepted. Anyone receiving money for goods  
quickly converted it back into other goods, and the money never stopped moving, doing the work  
of ten times the amount moving a tenth as fast.

Chancellor Wirth's government broke down under the strain in mid-November, and as that  
month passed away the mark fell to 30,000, 32,000, 34,000 to the pound — 8,000 to the dollar.  
The Reichsbank had proclaimed, and was now carrying out, a programme of unlimited printing  
of notes. More and more printing presses were employed for the work, and by December the  
amount issued was limited only by the capacity of the presses and the physical fatigue of the  
printers. Lord D'Abernon reported to London: 'The exchange market and the Reichsbank are like  
a runaway horse with an incompetent rider — each aggravates the folly of the other;' or, as he  
described it in another happy burst of metaphor: 'In the whole course of history, no dog has ever  
run after its own tail with the speed of the Reichsbank. The discredit the Germans throw on their  
own notes increases even faster than the volume of notes in circulation. The effect is greater than  
the cause. The tail goes faster than the dog.'

Scarcity of money was one of the reasons for the precipitous drop in real terms — though not, of  
course, in money terms — of industrial shares. Towards the end of the summer, in terms of gold,  
they had fallen to about one-tenth of their pre-war value, a substantial loss for consistent holders  
of these securities although nothing like that suffered by those who held War Loan and other  
fixed interest stock whose values were wiped out. In August the Berliner Tageblatt assessed the  
total value of all German companies at not more than 4 milliard gold marks (about £200 million),  
and said, while pointing to the danger that their shares might systematically be bought up by  
foreigners, that 'the picture of German industrial prosperity is widely different from that current  
in certain organs of the London and Paris press.'

In nominal terms, a basket of shares of companies which had not inflated or otherwise altered  
their peace-time capital had risen between July 1914 and July 1922 by 13.4 times. They included  
mining shares (Gelsenkirchen, up from 181 to 1,374; Muhlheimer, up from 155 to 1,990), and a  
broad spectrum of industry (Schwelmer Eisenwerk, from 135 to 2,800; Deutsche Waffen- und  
Munitions-fabriken, from 331 to 1,605; Kammgarnspinnerei Düsseldorf, from 131 to 2,550;  
Hotelbetriebs Berlin, from 136 to 2,100; Anglo-Continentale Guanowerke, from 119 to 1,776).  
But that rise compared with a 143-fold rise in the value of the gold mark against the paper one.  
At the end of the war the share price index had fallen in real terms to about one-third of its 1913  
level. The year 1921 saw it at one-fifth. In October 1922 it dropped to three-hundredths, at which

point it was a popular felicity that the Daimler Motor Company, factories, lands, reserves, capital  
and organisation, could have been swapped for the price of 327 of its cars. Demand for shares  
was small, too, because the average dividend yield on equities was only a quarter per cent — for  
the biggest shareholders preferred it so — and there were many less unsatisfactory ways of  
getting a return on capital when that was wanted.

The Report of the Deutsche Bank for 1921 showed clearly how greatly inflation had reduced the  
gold value of dividends, in contrast to the illusion of prosperity which high paper dividends  
caused. The bank's paper turnover of 2,125 milliards in 1921 had a real value of 85 milliard gold  
marks. In 1913, when the bank's ramifications were less extensive, the turnover had been 129  
milliards. The 1922 dividend on a capital of 400 million was equivalent to 1.5 million gold  
marks, against the 25 million dividend distributed in 1913 at 12 per cent on a capital of 200  
million.

October 1922, however, was the nadir for shareholders. From then on not only did money find its  
way back into shares, but people who could obtain cheap credit, or were unable to send their  
money abroad, began to realise the advantages of buying up their own country's industrial and  
other assets at a fraction of their true value. Although in real terms the stock market began to go  
up, the mark's purchasing power continued to go down.

'By the end of the year,' said Erna von Pustau,

my allowance and all the money I earned were not worth one cup of coffee. You could go to the  
baker in the morning and buy two rolls for 20 marks; but go there in the afternoon and the same  
two rolls were 25 marks. The baker didn't know how it happened ... His customers didn't know  
... It had somehow to do with the dollar, somehow to do with the stock exchange — and  
somehow, maybe, to do with the Jews.'

Mr Seeds's chauffeur can have been no less confused. He and millions like him still instinctively  
regarded the mark as being as good as gold, failing to realise how desperately sick it had  
become. Milk which had cost him an unbelievable 78 marks a litre in the first week of November  
cost him 202 marks a month later. Butter had risen from 800 to 2000 marks a lb.; sugar from 90 a  
Ib. to 220; eggs from 22 each to 30. Although potatoes were still available for 8 marks a lb., an  
increase of only 1 mark, he had to pay 1,400 marks for 1 lb. of eatable sausages to go with them.

Issues of authorised Notgeld were now as common as Reichsbank paper over most of the  
country. These emergency notes could be printed in any denomination up to 500 marks, and in  
some cases up to 1,000 marks — the limits had to be regularly raised — and were redeemable in  
Reichsbank notes after two or three months. By the middle of November there were 40 issuing  
bodies in the occupied territories alone. They included industries as diverse as Anilin and  
Sodafabrik of Ludwigshafen, the Düsseldorf Landesbank, Stahl-werk Becker-Willich, and  
Linoleumfabrik-Maximiliansau — chemicals, banking, steel and flooring. The towns who were  
paying their employees with their own currency included Krefeld, Coblenz, Düsseldorf,  
Duisburg, Worms, Treves, Mayence, Bonn, and Cologne where the bills were signed by Konrad  
Adenauer.

It was against this background of exploding prices and a multiplying issue of national and local  
currency that the fourth London conference provided the curtain raiser to 1923, the year of the  
wheelbarrow. That meeting, itself a preliminary to another in Paris, met in December to consider  
whether a moratorium on reparations ought to be granted. It was remarkable not merely for the  
presence of Signer Mussolini representing Italy, but for M. Poincare's firm announcement to Mr  
Bonar Law that 'Whatever happens, I shall advance into the Ruhr on January 15.' It was France,  
not Britain who, in Sir Eric Geddes's famous phrase of 1918 was intent on getting 'everything out  
of Germany that you can get out of a lemon and a bit more,' determined to 'squeeze her until you  
can hear the pips squeak.'

Lloyd George's opinion of Poincare's proposals made in London four months earlier had been  
that they 'showed either a total inability to grasp even the alphabet of economic conditions  
governing payments from one country to another, or a sinister resolve to engineer a German  
default under the treaty which would justify an invasion of the Westphalian minefields with  
ulterior possibilities of detaching them from the German fatherland.'

Bonar Law, who fully appreciated that the stabilisation of the mark meant, for Germany,  
unemployment, an industrial crisis and enormous financial strain, whereas failure to stabilise  
meant catastrophe, was now equally unable to convince the French Prime Minister of the futility  
of amassing vast quantities of German paper marks by means of retortionary or extortionary  
measures. Already 1,500 milliards of them had been collected by the German customs on the  
Allied reparations account, which the Reparations Commission dared not cash because it would  
hardly get anything for them. Poincare was obstinately sure, wrote Lloyd George, that the  
exploitation of the German forests could easily be carried out under the supervision of the Allied  
military authorities, and that it would be practical for them to control the Reichsbank and force  
up the value of the mark. The invasion of the Ruhr was to prove him tragically wrong. Whether it  
was intended to wreck Germany for ever or not, it was a policy that in time reduced the French  
franc to one-fifth of its pre-war value.

On December 10 the London conference received a Note from Germany's new Chancellor, Dr  
Wilhelm Cuno, suggesting various measures for stabilising the mark, including a two-year  
moratorium on reparation payments. The Note was rejected. Poincare, insisting on 'productive  
pledges' from Berlin, was further angered just before Christmas by Germany's proposing a go-  
year peace pact, which he regarded as no more than a manoeuvre.

Events moved inexorably on to the Paris conference and beyond. France and Great Britain parted  
brass rags on January 4. The French, Belgian and Italian members of the Reparation Commission  
with Britain dissenting decided on January 9, 1923, that Germany had been in voluntary default  
on her coal and timber deliveries under the peace treaty. There was then no legal way of  
preventing Poincare from carrying out his threats, and the hope of America's interceding was  
vain. On January 10, indeed, the United States occupying forces were withdrawn. On January 11  
Poincare despatched a control commission of engineers to the Ruhr 'for the purpose of securing  
deliveries', accompanied by troops 'for the protection of this commission and to ensure the  
execution of its mission.' For good measure, the French Prime Minister warned that if necessary  
sanctions and coercive measures would be used.

Ostensibly the purpose of the invasion of the Ruhr was, in the popular phrase, 'to bring Germany  
to her senses' and to compel her to pay up. How the temporary severance of her principal  
industrial region was to make it easier for her to do so remained unexplained. Lloyd George's  
opinion, strongly to be supported by the events of the summer, was that its true motive was to set  
up a Rhineland confederation friendly to France. He called it 'an act of military aggression  
against an unarmed nation that was as unjustified as it was to prove unprofitable.' It had one  
result fraught with long-term consequences — that of persuading many Germans that  
rearmament should be pursued at the earliest opportunity. Immediately, however, its effects on  
Germany were simultaneously dynamic and — in the dramatic sense — catastrophic. The  
country was scandalised. Lacking an army big enough to take counter-measures, she riposted in  
the only way that came to mind: the policy of passive resistance in the newly occupied areas.

The Ruhrkampf, as it was known, thus presented a tragically instructive economic picture. The  
industrial heart of Germany practically stopped beating. Hardly anyone worked: hardly anything  
ran. Coal mining never entirely stopped, some mine-owners pleading that reserves (which were  
always seized by the French) should be maintained. The population of the Ruhr area — 2 million  
workers, 6 million souls — had to be supported by the rest of the country. The German economy,  
however, called upon to subsidise an open-ended general strike, was not only denied its most  
important domestic products and raw materials — coal, coke, iron and steel in particular — but  
was robbed of its former enormous foreign earnings from Rhine-Ruhr exports. The Exchequer  
was itself deprived of all the normal tax revenue from a huge proportion of the nation's industry,  
as well as the coal tax and the income from the Ruhr railways. Furthermore, because of the  
Ruhr's international mineral importance, the world price of coal and steel, which Germany now  
had to import, proceeded to rise, increasing the difficulties still more.

Almost certainly the policy of passive resistance forced the invaders to act on a wider scale than  
they had contemplated. The French franc from then on moved sharply downwards and France's  
war indemnities drifted further off than ever. Yet France could not allow herself to lose the  
battle, any more than the German government could have capitulated before force majeure: the  
German nation would not have stood for it, least of all in the first months when the unity of  
purpose of all classes in the Ruhr so astonished everybody. Both sides were therefore totally  
committed in a holy war — and the German government knew of only one weapon. The Ruhr  
struggle was between French pressure and subversion on the one hand — it took many forms,  
economic, diplomatic, military, political — and the German printing press on the other. So long  
as paper banknotes were exchangeable for food, the fight would go on. When they were not, it  
did not.

Until the Ruhr invasion the reasons for the German inflation could have been put down, first, to  
the uncertainty of the aftermath of the war, and secondly, to the inexperience and weak  
acquiescence of the new men in power. Industry wanted neither heavy taxation nor to be  
hampered in its expansion at home or abroad: so the government gave way and replaced the  
missing revenue by printing it. Neither the industrialists nor the general public were prepared to  
pay the true costs of the railways, or of the post office, or even of bread: so the government  
understood, and printed the money to pay for them. Did Germany's nationals have claims arising  
out of the war, or, better, out of the peace treaty? Did one of the federal states, or the meanest  
district, look to Berlin to meet its financial requirements? The government printed notes to  
satisfy everyone, telling itself that as the granting of credit through cheques had so greatly

decreased the actual currency in circulation had to be so much greater. The rich and the strong  
came off best.

One of the results of unlimited inflation had been the destruction of State credit abroad. At the  
end of 1922 other results were beginning to show. In consequence of Germany's strong  
competitive position, German goods again were available all over the world, although still in  
only a third of pre-war quantities: owing to everyone's spending most income as quickly as  
possible, Germany's home market had absorbed incredible amounts of the national product, to  
the greater short-term benefit of industry.

Since the middle of 1922, the problems of private payments and private credit, both in and  
outside the country, had become much more difficult; but the exporter was generally well placed  
in regard to restocking with raw materials, as he could use the proceeds of foreign sales.  
Comparison of various German exports, as for instance chemicals, earthenware or metalware,  
with those from other countries showed that German export prices were often ridiculously low;  
although part of the reason was that exporters were careful that their profits should not be made  
at the time of leaving Germany but on the subsequent resale, so evading the regulation by which  
foreign earnings had to be repatriated. Many export profits were thus immune from everything  
from capital levy to financial crash. On the other hand, those importing raw materials for selling  
on the home market were in a bad way. Exorbitant interest rates, at 25 per cent a month, and the  
universal shortage of money meant that normal commercial life was seriously hampered. It was  
enough that employers and employees were already in continual session fixing wage tariffs  
which were usually out of date as soon as they came into force, and that all internal values had  
become so distorted that confusion was complete at all levels of commerce.

Conditions in the motor trade reflected the difficulties of manufacturing industry generally under  
the uncertainties of inflationary finance. The number of cars in the country in 1922, at one for  
every 360 people, was not great compared, say, to France (one for every 176), Britain (one for  
every 91), or the United States (one for every 10). But the scope for sales was correspondingly  
greater, and demand was very high. Foreigners, nouveau riche businessmen and, because it was  
found that cars were cheaper to maintain than horses, landed proprietors were usually the buyers:  
since the war, the gentleman owner who kept a car for the fun of it had practically disappeared.  
The cost of petrol, at 17 marks a litre (|d) in January 1922 was at 686 at the end of the year.

High demand availed the dealer little. The ten-horse-power car, for example, which (with  
lighting and starting sets, but no tyres, because they were generally purveyed separately) in  
January 1922 cost 220,000 marks (about £270), and in August cost 1.25 million, by January  
1923 cost 114 million marks, or half, or twice as much depending upon which end of that  
frenzied month one bought it, the sterling price remaining much the same. Similarly, a four-ton  
motor lorry (without tyres, but with body, and with acetylene lighting) had risen in price between  
January and January from 265,000 marks (£320) to 12.9 million. Pneumatic tyres (one non-skid  
cover and one inner tube) had risen from 4,920 (£6) to 161,000 marks, and solid tyres even more,  
from 3,691 (£4 IDS) to 202,095 marks apiece.

It was quite impossible to quote prices in advance, and customers themselves would not take the  
risk of committing themselves to the so-called 'gliding clause' in a contract: for otherwise, after  
payment of a non-returnable deposit, the final bill could be almost limitless, depending on the

delivery date. As a result, dealers whose financial resources were already under enormous strain  
were constantly engaged in unpleasant correspondence with both clients and suppliers.  
Moreover, it took a long time for the trade to iron out the quarrel between dealer and  
manufacturer over the deposit paid by the one when ordering from the other: normally a third of  
the current price would have to be put down, but by the time of delivery, which was very slow,  
that deposit had become a minute proportion of the final price — and the manufacturers unfairly  
insisted that the full nominal balance should be met. In any case, throughout the trade it was  
being found that the sums realised from sales would not replace stocks.

The unsatisfactory conditions of internal commerce had their effect in persuading the Exchequer  
that an unbalanced budget had to be accepted. Revenue from taxation, export duties and customs  
dues in the last nine months of 1922 amounted to 324 milliard marks, or about £10 million at the  
current rate of exchange. Government expenditure over the same period, on the other hand, had  
come to 1,173 milliard marks, or about £40 million. The deficit had been made up by increasing  
the floating debt with note issues amounting to nearly 850 milliards. The very low levels in real  
terms of both expenditure and revenue showed how much the finances of a highly-industrialised  
nation of more than 60 million people had gone to pieces. Inside the country at Christmas time  
the mark was worth one-1,723rd of its pre-war value: outside the country it was worth only one-  
1,92 3rd.

In that unhealthy picture the government can have seen only two relatively bright patches. One  
was that the country's internal debt, to the distress of the stockholders, had dwindled to nothing.  
The other was the almost total absence of unemployment; but workless-ness, of course, had been  
the Socialist government's greatest fear ever since the Army had started to disband, and that fear  
had been in large measure behind the inflationary policy.

Even in Bavaria, however, the close of 1922 for most people meant a return to wartime  
conditions. People were once more issued with bread and sugar cards, and supplies were doubly  
affected by the extreme shortage of fuel. For these privations the fall of the mark was the official  
excuse — but it was seldom believed, for prices were seen to rise equally steeply during periods  
of temporary currency stability. The coal shortage was attributed squarely by everyone to the  
Allies' demands in kind made under the peace treaty.

Apart from widows, pensioners, and the like, observed Mr Seeds, the population of Bavaria was  
not on the verge of starvation: the poorer quarters of English towns could have shown as many  
glaring cases of poverty. He thought the middle classes were still hard up rather than poverty-  
stricken — and out of a population of 7 million, a mere 16,000 were out of work. Bavaria,  
however, had become more than ever a forcing house for the reactionary movements, and the  
progress during the previous twelve months of the National Socialist Party had been one of the  
year's most remarkable features. Hitler's Storm Troops, the SA, founded in November 1921,  
numbered 6,000 within a year, and were permitted to train and manoeuvre alongside the  
Reichswehr.

'Formerly,' Mr Seeds reported to the Berlin Embassy, the NSDAP's existence was only known  
through enormous red placards, advertising public speeches to be delivered by Herr Hitler, which  
always closed with the notice 'No admission to Jews!' Anti-Semitism seemed the chief plank in  
his platform, but in general he was anti-everything: the Entente, the Reich government, the

capitalists, the Bavarian government at times, the Socialists and the Communists — all were  
depicted in eloquent language as betrayers of the people. The public attitude was, at first, one of  
amusement; but as time went on and both political and economic conditions grew from bad to  
worse, the tendency arose to consider Hitler as the man who was always in the right.

Bit by bit, Seeds explained, the star of Hitler began to outshine the medals of Ludendorff.  
Economic salvation had become for most people the more pressing need. They were being  
turned from politics by the cost of living, poor wages and low salaries. Hitler alone was capable  
of trimming his ship to every wind; and, in a word, the middle class was going Nazi.

All this, and the Ruhr invasion too. As a result of the war Germany had lost nine-tenths of her  
merchant fleet and all her colonies. She had lost the coal and zinc of Upper Silesia, the potash of  
Alsace and the iron ore of Lorraine. She had lost to France the control of the Saar mines. She had  
lost more than 14 per cent of her cultivated land — 15 per cent of her former wheat crops and 18  
per cent of her potatoes. All German capital held abroad had been confiscated.

Looking at it in its worst light — as Dr Stresemann was happy to do as Chancellor later that year  
when appealing for overseas aid -Germany was already an amputated corpse (he said) racked  
with bitterness, working only an eight-hour day, when the French and Belgian armies under  
General Degoutte moved in to claim their missing telegraph poles on January n. The Ruhr basin  
in 1923 provided nearly 85 per cent of Germany's remaining coal resources, and 80 per cent of  
her steel and pig-iron production; accounted for 70 per cent of her traffic in goods and minerals;  
and contained 10 per cent of her population. The loss of the Ruhr's production, and all it implied,  
was therefore a bale of last straws. At 35,000 to the pound at Christmas 1922, the mark fell to  
48,000 on the day after the invasion, and at the end of January 1923 touched 227,500, well over  
50,000 to the dollar.

That was the moment when the Reichsbank circulated its first 100,000-mark note. Its purchasing  
power equalled a little more than two dollars, or ten shillings sterling: perhaps a tenth or a  
fifteenth of what its face-value must have been when it was on the drawing-board. It did not  
matter: a million-mark note was on the stocks and would be issued within another three weeks.

### 9: Ruhrkampf

IT is a phenomenon of any national group that, almost however much it is riven with dissent, an  
external threat will unite it. By all accounts the entry of the French and Belgian armies into the  
Ruhr had a galvanising effect on a disintegrating German nation. As Tirpitz felt called upon to  
say in an unwelcome eulogy of the Anglo-Saxons, fate seemed to have assigned to France 'the  
historic role of welding the divergent forces of our people into unity again and again.' Not only  
did all Germany rally at once to the notion of supporting their brothers on the Rhine: the Socio-  
political fever in the industrial areas itself subsided in a torrent of national passion directed  
against the common enemies.

A sudden absence of class hatred was a remarkable feature, helped by the willingness of some of  
the industrialists — notably some mine-owners and directors — to be arrested and imprisoned  
for non-cooperation along with their employees. They became national heroes. In Berlin, even  
the Left-wing Independent Socialist Party was happy to give its temporary support to the  
government of Cuno. Indeed, what was termed 'the revival of the national spirit' was a matter for  
universal comment. Only Ludendorff failed to cash in on the new awakening by taking the  
appeal for unity all the way to Vienna where, though still in desperate poverty despite the health  
of the krone, people remembered on which side their bread was buttered: he was greeted with  
shouts of 'To the gallows!' and 'Down with the murderer of millions!' and had to be smuggled  
back to his own country.

'All the old patriotic songs were sung,' said Erna von Pustau. 'Even Father gave money to help  
the Ruhr. Clothes were collected. The coal shortage began. We had cold houses again, but we  
were willing to suffer cold for our fatherland.'

With the absence — in prison or the unoccupied part of the country — of the managerial staff of  
the mines and forests, what had begun (ostensibly at least) as an administrative operation quickly  
escalated into a stark and often brutal military occupation. The Ruhr basin's Coal Syndicate was  
replaced with Franco-Belgian officials. The administration of forests, customs and export  
licences throughout the newly occupied area was taken over. A customs cordon was set up  
between the Rhine-Ruhr and unoccupied Germany, through which all coal exports were  
prohibited. The rail link between unoccupied Germany and Switzerland was cut, and French and  
Belgian personnel were introduced to the Ruhr state railways. With these alien operatives the  
German workers would have little to do, and their former management and officials suffered  
accordingly.

Within a fortnight of January 11, mayors, lord mayors, customs officers at all levels, police  
directors and commissioners, local councillors and revenue officers were being hounded out of  
their jobs and homes. The Chief Commissioner of Forests was dismissed, along with his assistant  
commissioners at Cleve, Speyer, Mainz and Treves. The director of the Wiesbaden chief customs  
house was replaced. In protest at the arrest of the Mayor of Essen, all shops and restaurants in the  
town were closed in the middle of the day -until the French forces started reprisals.

These examples give an idea of the petty official level at which the Ruhr operation was directed.  
Its scale, however, was far from petty. During the occupation 147,000 Germans were actually

expelled from the Ruhr by General Degoutte, including 5,764 railway workers and 17,237 of  
their dependants. More than 2,000 people were wounded and 376 killed. Every town in Germany  
as far east as Breslau was burdened with Ruhr refugees. Apart from the economic damage it did,  
the Ruhr struggle added incalculably to an already horrific sum of human misery.

The passive resistance was not so passive as the government quite genuinely intended it to be.  
Sabotage of the railways became a popular pastime, and bridges, points and junctions were  
dynamited at regular intervals. Signals were jammed, and the railway officials made a point of  
losing or destroying freight waybills, particularly any relating to perishable goods which were  
subsequently pillaged. French military trains were derailed and ships sunk in the canals; and no  
coal flowed westwards except at sporadic intervals.

With the wave of nationalism that swept through Germany after the French invasion, the  
reactionary movements hurried out into the open with the tacit support of the German Army and  
financial encouragement from the industrialists. The National Socialists, the Deutsche National  
Volkische Partei and the Fascisti organisations made huge capital out of 'Ruhr patriotism' —  
Hitler appeared personally in the Ruhr on a recruiting drive — and played as large a part as any  
in arranging the disruption of the area. Most of these movements, notably the 'Orgesch' (which  
was known to be supported by Stinnes), had strong military and student backing, and were based  
in Bavaria. However, the disaffected and out-of-work in the Ruhr did their share of discouraging  
the forces of occupation; and there were even instances of well-paid workers from the rest of the  
country — such was the chauvinistic fervour which the Ruhrkampf excited — who would spend  
their annual holidays on jaunts to the Ruhr with the object of shooting a French officer or  
blowing up a supply train.

In reply to all this the French and Belgians arrested, gaoled and executed, and diplomatically  
both they and the German government worked themselves into an impasse from which  
extrication without loss of face became impossible. Russian agents, as might have been expected,  
began to pour into the Ruhr, but in general found that the flood of paper money which  
accompanied them was more than a match for the weasel words of Bolshevism, at least in the  
beginning. By March Russian propaganda in the Ruhr had ceased because the Soviets did not  
want to appear unsympathetic to the "popular distress. In contrast, the French then started to act  
in collusion with the local Communists in order to undermine the German authorities. This  
stimulation by France of the Rote Hundertschaften, the 'Red Centuries' operating in the Rhine-  
Ruhr, echoed the policy which the German High Command had adopted six years before in  
shipping Lenin off in the sealed train to Petrograd during the war in order to hasten the  
disintegration of Czarist Russia.

In the matter of popular patriotism Munich distinguished itself from the rest of Germany by a  
rigid adherence for several months to the manifestations of mourning and indignation which had  
been inaugurated with the first day of the occupation. No dancing in public or private was  
permitted, despite the losses suffered by those classes whose livelihoods depended on such  
things. No Frenchman could show himself with impunity in a restaurant, shop or other public  
place, a practice in respect of which Berlin was far more lenient. Moreover, as Mr Seeds  
reported, the perpetual singing of 'Deutschland uber Alles' often entailed savage assaults on any  
foreigners who, by inadvertence or boredom, failed to rise to their feet.

Committed as they were to a monetary programme of unlimited printing, the government and the  
Reichsbank fully recognised that if the value of the mark continued to sink for ever the days in  
which the population of the Ruhr could be sustained in idleness must be very short. For that  
reason, by the middle of February large amounts of foreign bills were being thrown on to the  
market at home and abroad by the Reichsbank to support the rate of exchange, a policy  
immediately made possible by the government's having suspended reparation payments for the  
duration of hostilities. As excess paper was mopped up, the price of the mark rose sharply, and  
by February 20 recovered by more than half, moving from 50,000 to the dollar to 20,000. One  
encouraging consequence was a favourable reaction in wholesale prices. A distressing one was  
the correspondingly severe fall on the Bourse, as every speculative calculation went wildly  
wrong.

The main reminder, however, that sanity had not even thought of returning was the appearance  
of more and more paper from the Reichsbank presses. During February the note circulation was  
being increased by a matter of 450 milliards every week. On a single day in early March, by way  
of Treasury bills discounted at the Reichsbank, the floating debt was increased by 800 milliards.

The anomaly of a currency temporarily stable on the world market and roaring inflation at home  
— accompanied by the usual price increases — did not go unremarked. The Berliner Tageblatt  
roundly condemned the Reichsbank credit policy for 'giving advantage to individuals at the  
expense of the community by clinging to the fiction of a paper mar k\* which has long ceased to  
be a reservoir or even a measure of value.' The main reference was to the continuing tendency of  
industrial and other concerns, partly in order to avoid taxation but more so as not to hold marks,  
to put every spare mark into extensions, renewals or improvements — a practice which for many  
months the French had been watching with mounting disapproval, unable to reconcile it with  
Germany's protestations of national poverty.

Nevertheless, the mark maintained its position at just under 100,000 to the pound throughout  
March and for the first two weeks of April. It survived a further incursion of the French Army on  
March 13 across the Rhine to occupy parts of Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Darmstadt; and the  
news that the Japanese were placing new shipbuilding contracts in Britain rather than Hamburg,  
It survived the collapse of the franc which, at between so and 35 to the pound before the war,  
now sank from 66 to 77, relieving the French rentiers of another sixth of their purchasing  
power.\* (\*By March, French coke prices were at double the January figure.) It survived the  
troubles which accompanied the suppression of a Bavarian separatist plot in Munich; and the.  
worries repeatedly expressed in the Reichstag about the manoeuvrings of 8,000 troops under the  
direction of Herr Hitler in the same town. It even survived the announcement of a budget deficit  
of 7,000 milliard marks, or £70 million (about four times the January level) which, as everybody  
knew, only printing would make good.

The Leipzig Spring Fair, held in early April despite the country's troubles, was a disappointment  
to exporters for the very reason that export prices were now too high to get orders, and that  
because of the mark's stability on foreign exchanges inland prices were often higher than export  
prices when expressed in foreign currencies. The wild fluctuations in the mark's value over the  
previous months when the goods were actually being manufactured meant extraordinary price  
differences throughout the fair — amounting to as much as 60 per cent for the same type of  
wares. The only products in which traders could hope to prosper were in those like toys and fine

mechanical instruments where Germany still enjoyed something of a monopoly: but German  
leather goods, glass and crystal, for example, were now being severely undercut by the United  
Kingdom.

Visitors to the fair found that German firms seemed to be concentrating upon large quantities of  
low-class goods — the inference being that their production ensured maximum employment,  
would meet the greatly reduced inland purchasing power, and in addition gratify the Germans'  
need and urge to get rid of all their paper money. The average citizen these days preferred buying  
three pairs of indifferent leather boots to buying one good pair. At the fair he was being offered  
mouth organs at the equivalent of 175 a dozen, or concertinas at half a guinea each. His was  
becoming in many respects a cheapjack country.

It could only be a matter of time before the Bank's capacity to support the currency ran out. The  
government attempted to raise a gold loan with the issue of dollar Treasury bonds, (repayable  
at'120 per cent three years later) but found that afer all people preferred to hold on to any foreign  
currency they had. When the first official results of the loan were announced in the last days of  
March, it turned out to be still undersubscribed by 75 per cent. The lack of confidence this news  
engendered led to a demand for foreign currencies greater than ever before; but it was not until  
April 18 when Hugo Stinnes presented the Reichsbank with a demand for £93,000 in foreign  
bills that the intervention policy came to grief. Support was withdrawn. The mark broke; and it  
was decided to let the exchange find a more realistic level. Within twenty-four hours the mark  
was at 140,000 to the pound, and still sliding.

'Inflation is like a drug in more ways than one,' remarked Lord D'Abernon. 'It is fatal in the end,  
but it gets its votaries over many difficult moments.' Hopelessly addicted, the Reichsbank  
ploughed on. The foreign currency holdings having failed to keep the mark steady while more  
and more paper notes gushed forth day upon day-, the gold reserves had been thrown into the  
breach as well in March these stood at i;oo4 million gold marks, equivalent to just over £50  
million. By the middle of May one-fifth of them had gone, good money after bad — at a time,  
moreover, when those reserves would almost certainly still have been a sufficient basis for the  
issue" of a stable currency.

From the spring onwards, the gold reserves dwindled away (not exclusively in support of the  
mark: much was spent on essential imports of food and British coal); and more and more  
desperate attempts were made to control the market in foreign exchange. Such intervention as  
sporadically took place thereafter to stem the fall of the currency contrived at best to brake its  
descent for a few days at a time. Almost invariably these attempts made it easier for speculators  
to pick up foreign currencies at artificially low prices. The regulation in May requiring banks to  
report in detail any purchases of foreign currency made on behalf of their clients was simply  
tinkering with one of inflation's natural side-effects; and the three dozen or so separate  
ordinances which were to follow, governing the buying, selling and even the casual holding of  
foreign money, in turn did little more than hamper the normal workings of commerce.

Prices went up, and although there was no weakening of resolve in the country at large or in the  
Ruhr in particular, to continue the enfeebling struggle with France, morale began to sink,  
especially in the Rhmeland. If the small Francophil party there had then decided under French  
backing to proclaim a Rhenish Republic, most of the population would probably have closed

their eyes and accepted the situation. The separatist movement gave the Communists the  
opportunity to stir up trouble all the way from Essen to Frankfort. The flood of refugees into  
unoccupied Germany increased in size and caused there as many economic and social problems  
as they thought they had left behind. Labour leaders who stayed at home were now beginning to  
demand work in lieu of an increasingly inadequate dole. With May Day, when Hitler's attempt to  
use his stormtroopers to break up the traditional trade union demonstrations in Munich — and if  
possible force the Reich into civil war — was thwarted by the local Reichswehr commandant,  
von Lossbw, the mark dropped past 200,000 to the pound. Curzon's endeavour\* (\*In April, a  
month before Baldwin, to Curzon's chagrin, succeeded Bonar Law as Prime Minister, d. Harold  
Nicolson, Curzon: 'the Last Phase, Chapter XII.) to break the Ruhr deadlock by appealing to  
Germany to make a new offer in respect of reparation payments came to nothing.

Ernest Hemingway returned to Kehl in late April, fortified by a visa obtained from the German  
consular attache in Paris with the aid of a bribe. Since the year before, the little Rhineland town  
'had been transformed.

The waiter sat down at the table. 'No, there is no one here now,' he said. 'All the people you say  
you saw in July cannot come now. — The French will not give them passports to come to  
Germany ... The merchants and restaurant keepers in Strasbourg got angry and went to the  
police because everybody was coming over here to eat so much cheaper and now nobody in  
Strasbourg can get a passport to come here ... Now no Germans can get passports to go across  
the river to Strasbourg where many worked. They could work cheaper than the French, so that is  
what happened to them. All our factories here are shutdown. No coal, no trains. This was. one of  
the biggest and busiest stations in Germany. Now nix. No trains, except the military trains, and  
they run when they please ... We haven't had any fun since 1914. If you made any money it gets  
no good, and there is only to spend, it. That is what we do. Last year I had enough money saved  
up to buy a Gasthaus at Hernberg: now that money wouldn't buy four bottles of Champagne.'

Hemingway recorded for the Toronto Daily Star that Champagne then Jzost 38,000 marks a  
bottle, luncheon 3,500 marks, a sandwich 900 marks, and beer 350 marks a stein.

I remembered that last July I stayed at a de luxe hotel with Mrs Hemingway for 600 marks a day.  
'Sure,' the waiter went on, 'I read the French papers. Germany debases her money to cheat the  
Allies. But what do I get out of it?'

The answer was that the waiter got nothing out of inflation, and — apart from relieving itself of a  
further minute proportion of the remaining minute fraction of the national debt — nor now did  
the Exchequer. There were those, however, who were doing better than ever. A currency  
speculator who borrowed from the Reichsbank on January 1, 1933, enough paper marks (about  
1,980 million) to buy 100,000 dollars, and on April 1 sold enough dollars (about 80,000) to repay  
the bank, and who again borrowed the equivalent of 100,000 dollars and continued thus until the  
end of May, could have made the equivalent of a quarter of a million dollars at the expense of the  
acceptors of pure marks. His problem then, of course, was in what form to keep his profits: if  
they were in marks, they would evaporate before his eyes.

That evaporation was inevitable. In March, April and May the government's income was a mere  
30 per cent of its expenditure; and during May the working classes actually paid more to the

Reich in tax than the assessed tax payers of the higher social classes, for the reason that whereas  
the former could be tapped at source, the others had to fill in returns which were long out of date  
by the time the administrative machine could deal with them. Between May Day and May 31 the  
mark fell from 220,000 to 320,000 to the pound. The First of June was celebrated with the issue  
of the first five-million-mark note.

Speculation in currency was in no way the exclusive domain of the financially informed. Anyone  
— banker, politician, businessman or workman — who observed that there were easier ways of  
keeping one's head above water than the now very problematic one of working for it was ready  
to indulge as opportunity offered. It was computed that well over a million Germans in early  
1923 were engaged in exchange speculation. Their dealings took place mainly through the so-  
called Winkelbankiers, the back-street operators who had sprung up with inflation and, battening  
on an unhealthy economy, made a living entirely through taking advantage of the difference in  
the buying and selling prices of foreign currencies. Although they were not even members of the  
Bourse, they played a significant part in determining the daily rate of exchange — and, indeed,  
to the arbitrage machinations of the Winkelbankiers was attributed the fact that Berlin invariably  
closed at a lower rate than New York.

By the end of May 1923 no single reform, possibly no half dozen measures, would have been  
enough to avert ultimate disaster. Small reforms were made: a law was passed on May 19 to  
liquidate holdings of Government stock of less than 5,000 marks, because they cost too much to  
administer — and 920,000 holders of War Loan alone who had paid up to £250 to help the war  
effort were compelled to accept the nominal value (at most, 6d) for their stock. In another  
improvement, the Minister of the Interior permitted the substitution of paste-board coffins for  
wooden ones, especially for the rising number of pauper funerals. Otherwise, the Government  
contented itself with steps to postpone the inevitable.

Until the Ruhr invasion the inflationist policy had been mainly governed by the fear of  
unemployment. Now massive unemployment had come — although the revival of the national  
spirit' had greatly mitigated its worst disruptive side-effects — and inflation was pursued more  
vigorously than ever. As the Ruhr unemployment was fully subsidised it had no corresponding  
countervailing influence on the huge additional wage claims there or anywhere else. Conjointly  
the minds of Berlin turned ,,more earnestly towards reforming the tax system, which to a great  
degree meant persuading Stinnes and his friends to make real fiscal contributions to the  
Exchequer. In June, of the 511 milliard marks received in income tax, 'only 90 milliards came  
from assessed tax payers: wage-earners' prepayments accounted for the rest,, and Stinnes was  
increasingly seen to be a maleficent influence on Germany's finances. The Exchequer's only joy  
that month was in the increased yield from the Bourse turnover tax, which doubled because of a  
new rush of orders to buy German securities.

Petty crimp? the crime of desperation, was flourishing. Pilfering had of course been rife since the  
war, but now it began to occur on a larger, commercial scale. Metal plaques on national  
monuments had to be removed for safe-keeping. The brass bell plates were stolen from the front  
doors of the British Embassy in Berlin, part of a systematic campaign unpreventable by the  
police even in the Wilhelmstrasse and Unter den Linden. That members and families of the  
British Army of the Rhine suffered severely from burglaries probably reflected the fact, not that  
thieves had particular animus against the forces of occupation, but that these days foreigners

were so much more robbable than anyone else. Over most of Germany the lead was beginning to  
disappear overnight from roofs. Petrol was syphoned from the tanks of motor cars. Barter was  
already a usual form of exchange; but now commodities such as brass and fuel were becoming  
the currency of ordinary purchase and payment. A cinema seat cost a lump of coal. With a bottle  
of paraffin one might buy a shirt; with that shirt, the potatoes needed by one's family. Herr von  
der Osten kept a girl friend in the provincial Capital, for whose room in 1922 he had paid half a  
pound of butter a month: by the summer of 1923 it was costing him a whole pound. 'The Middle  
Ages came back,' Erna von Pustau said.

Communities printed their own money, based on goods, on a certain amount of potatoes, or rye,  
for instance. Shoe factories paid their workers in bonds for shoes which they could exchange at  
the bakery for bread or the meat market for meat.

Those with foreign currency, becoming easily the most acceptable paper medium, had the  
greatest scope for finding bargains. The power of the the dollar, in particular, far exceeded its  
nominal rate of exchange. Finding himself with a single dollar bill early in 1923, von der Osten  
got hold of six friends and went to Berlin one evening determined to blow the lot; but early the  
next morning, long after dinner, and many nightclubs later, they still had change in their pockets.  
There were stories of Americans in the greatest difficulties in Berlin because no-one had enough  
marks to change a five-dollar bill: of others who ran up accounts (to be paid off later in  
depreciated currency) on the strength of even bigger foreign notes which, after meals or services  
had been obtained, could not be changed; and of foreign students who bought up whole rows of  
houses out of their allowances.

There were stories of shoppers who found that thieves had stolen the baskets and suitcases in  
which they carried their money, leaving the money itself behind on the ground; and of life  
supported by selling every day or so a single tiny link from a long gold crucifix chain. There  
were stories (many of them, as the summer wore on and as exchange rates altered several times a  
day) of restaurant meals which cost more when the bills came than when they were ordered. A  
5,000-mark cup of coffee would cost 8,000 marks by the time it was drunk.

The reality behind such inflationary anecdotes, amusing in retrospect, was exceedingly grim. The  
agony was displayed as much by the shrunken-necked gentlemen to be seen in the streets with  
their mended white collars and shiny suits saved from the war as by the exhausted workmen  
queueing impatiently outside the pay windows with big shopping bags in which to rush their  
wages away to the shops. Badly off as wage-earners were, their standards were still at a level  
distantly comparable with the past. Throughout Germany, Austria and Hungary the old standards  
of salary earners, pensioners and people living on savings had often dropped almost, out of sight.

Lady Listowel,\* (Judith, Countess of Listowel, formerly Judith de Marffy-Mantuano.) whose  
father held a senior post in the Hungarian diplomatic service recalls the distress among the circle  
of her family's friends in Budapest:

One used to see the appearance of their flats gradually changing. One remembered where there  
used lo be a picture, or a carpet, or a secretaire. Eventually their rooms would be almost empty-  
and on paper'some people were reduced to nothing. In practice, people didn't just die. They were  
terribly hungry, and relations and friends would help with a little food from time to time. We

sent them parcels, or took them ourselves because we had no cash to pay for postage. And some  
of them begged — not in the streets — but by making casual visits (one knew only too well what  
they had come for) or by writing letters asking for help. Everyone still tried to keep up  
appearances: at first, early on, people looked around to see what economies they could make,  
what clubs to resign from, what luxuries to do without. Later it was a question of considering  
what necessities to do without.

And when food was not the problem — after all, we lived most of the time in the country where  
we could get it — there were troubles because we had no money. Only one of us could afford to  
go into Budapest at a time. There was no way to get medical help without money. If you had  
toothache you couldn't afford a dentist. If you needed to go to hospital, you might get into a  
convent: otherwise you stayed at home, and got better, or got worse.

In June after a brief pause, support for the mark was resumed. The reason was quite openly  
stated — to allay popular discontent which was assuming alarming proportions. The people had  
reason to complain. In the month following May 20, the price of an egg rose from 800 marks to  
2,400; of a litre of milk from 1,800 to 3,800, of a kilo of flour from 2,400 to 6,600, of pork from  
10,400 to 32,000. In the Ruhr, too, while salaries doubled (a workman's wage rose from 3,300 an  
hour to 6,800) the cost of commodities trebled. Tradesmen could not know how to establish  
prices, and often simply shut up shop. For these reasons, in a single day in June, 6 million gold  
marks were lost to the reserves in 'another of the Reichsbank's convulsive and desperate  
attempts', as Mr Joseph Addison put it, 'to bolster the mark by throwing foreign currency on the  
market — in this case with the object of bringing the dollar below 100,000.' The government's  
hopes again turned out to be illusions. In mid-June, the note circulation stood at 8,564 milliard  
marks. By June 21 the daily increase in the circulation was 157 milliards. By June 28 the mark  
was at 170,000 to the dollar, the total circulation had risen to 11,000 milliards, and no notes of  
less than 100,000 marks (2s 10d) were being printed.

In a letter to the Foreign Office on June 29 Addison recorded a circulation increase between June  
25 and 26 of 959,156,010,000 marks and between June 26 and 27 of 1,523,534,460,000: in one  
day, an increase in the increase of more than 500,000,000,000 marks. 'We are far from the  
modest daily increase of 160 milliards of a week ago,' he wrote, and added Mephistopheles's  
comment from Faust:

'Der kleine Gott der Welt bleibt stets von gleichem Schlag, 'Und ist so wunderlich als wie am  
ersten Tag.'\* (\*Roughly: "Earth's little lordling stays to his casting true, 'As odd as on the day  
when he was new.')

As the circulation swelled and the value of the mark fell, less and less importance attached to  
revenue from taxation. The increase in the floating debt recorded on June 27 — the 1,500  
milliards which had so startled Addison — was more than the Exchequer's total revenue (1, 400  
milliards) for the entire month of May. Although the Finance Ministry was working on plans to  
bring taxes up to a level proportionate to the mark's depreciation, the Reichsbank's policy of  
discounting and printing was bound to keep the mark far ahead of the game. In two and a half  
months-government expenditure had totalled the equivalent of £15.5 million against a revenue of  
only £5 million. In sterling terms these sums were trifling enough: but the truth was that a nation

of 60 million people was going bankrupt because (at, say, 500,000 marks to the pound) she could  
not raise even £30 million a year to meet expenditure of only £80 million.

Towards the end of June 1923, the government began turning with repeated, but undue,  
optimism to temporary expedients of all kinds. One nostrum was the multiplier, to be wielded by  
the Minister of Finance as he thought fit, to keep the rate of taxation on a par with that of  
depreciation. It worried no one in the ministry that it sinned deeply against Adam Smith's sacred  
canon of certainty which provides that taxpayers know clearly in advance what they have to pay.  
During May, income tax had been multiplied 25 times, and it was now announced that in August,  
when payment would be due, the multiplier would be 40. Yet it was obvious that the tax returns  
could never keep up with the speed of depreciation, from whatever source they came. The yield  
from consumption duties — for example, on tobacco, beer, wine, sugar, salt and playing cards —  
no longer even met the cost of their administration.

r The trouble was that all taxes were levied not on real but on current values, so that the Finance  
Minister, Dr Hermes, was in some ways right in protesting that to bring these duties up to normal  
world levels would have offered 'no financial guarantee for the future'. Despair was the keynote  
of his approach. The lightness of the tax burden on the German economy as a whole had become  
painfully evident, even though individuals were often heavily hit. Dr Hermes began to discuss  
nejv taxes on bills of exchange and on traffic in capital, and — potentially more significant —  
the prepayment of income and corporation taxes. This last, however, seems to have been mooted  
mainly as a palliative to the working classes.

In the second half of June it became necessary again to double the salaries of government  
officials, and to give higher grants to the war-wounded, to'widows, to pensioners and to the  
unemployed, in and out of the Ruhr, An additionaL reason for these increases, over and above  
the general fall in the mark's purchasing power, was that the poorer classes, especially the  
rentiers, would soon no longer be able to afford the price of bread. Agricultural interests had  
become angry about the 'Umlage', the forced delivery of the first two million tons of wheat  
produced each year which enabled half the total supply of bread to be sold cheap. From August  
onwards farmers were to be paid at world prices because, when obliged to sell wheat cheaply,  
they still had to pay the world price for fertilisers. The change in policy, from subsidising food to  
subsidising the needy, may have satisfied the farmers; but the extra subsidies for the poor soon  
became worthless again.

The third week in June produced yet another attempt to control speculation in foreign currencies  
by fixing the rate of exchange at which they might legally be traded. The penalties for infringing  
the new ordinance were unlimited fines and up to three years' gaol. Undertaken at the request of  
the bigger banks who were afraid of a popular attack on them if civil disorder were to break out,  
the measure was aimed at the continuing operations of the Winkel-banhiers, who would now be  
unable to make a price for the mark before the official quotation was known. It was determined  
first that German industry possessed enough foreign currency to meet its needs during the month  
in which the ordinance was to run, for otherwise it would have made the import business  
impossible and trade would have been brought to a standstill.

The Rhineland High Commission, however, refused to adopt the ordinance, so that huge  
transactions were soon taking place in Cologne, seriously depressing the mark exchange once

more. General Degoutte further declared it inapplicable in the Ruhr; and thus put France, which  
had frequently accused the Germans of wilfully debasing the mark, in the anomalous position of  
forbidding a move whose sole object was to strengthen it. The ordinance was by and large a  
failure, and in part had the effect — as a similar measure had had in Austria — of driving the  
Winkelbankier out of the open into the cafe round the corner. (In Austria the Bourse was  
compelled in the end to follow and then actually adopt the rates of the Schwarze Borse). On July  
2, the dollar opened in New York at 174,000 paper marks but closed in Berlin, under the  
influence of the Reichsbank, at 160,000. In other words, the Bank was selling dollars at 160,000  
marks in the full knowledge that the dollar was worth 14,000 more points abroad.

The next day, July 3, there appeared a new ordinance to forbid the buying of futures. It was  
partly aimed at restricting imports, for stocks were now very high and importers had been able to  
obtain great quantities of foreign bills during the period of heavy mark support. The consequence  
was that the Bourse rapidly became overloaded with demands for 'sight' bills rather than three-  
month bills; and of these only about a tenth could be satisfied. Accordingly importers began to  
apply for ten times the dollars they required in the hope of getting their full quota.

This ordinance was also aimed at those who sought to buy dollars at, say, 160,000 marks each  
and use the dollars to buy dollar Treasury bills quoted at a very much higher rate — an obvious  
way of making great gains. The higher quotation of the bills had even led people to believe that  
the dollar rate was artificial and that the bill rate was the genuine one. Over-ordering, however,  
meant that many firms were caught out:xwhen the Reichsbank, with more than usual astuteness,  
called their bluff by requiring cheques to meet the total application. In that it revealed which of  
the smaller banks were condoning exchange speculation this ordinance therefore had some  
success.'

And yet every effort to prevent foreign currency losses, every new attempt to hold the mark  
steady, was only trifling with the nation's troubles. The Reichsbank's Autonomy Act of May  
1922 had fully persuaded Dr Havenstein that he was master in his own house. Despite pressures  
mounting on all sides, he showed clearly that he had no intention of resigning, and every thought  
of pursuing his own convictions. Believing that it was in Berlin that the mark exchange had to be  
kept low, whatever it might do elsewhere, he willingly satisfied the demands of his public by  
selling what foreign currencies he had available. During the last days of June and the first days of  
July, as the mark sank from 600,000 to 800,000 to the pound, nearly 80 million gold marks — £2  
million -were thrown away, as Dr Bergmann, a high official in the Finance Ministry, admitted, in  
order to satisfy the greed of German speculators: only 1 million gold marks were meanwhile  
required for the more laudable purpose of supporting the mark in New York.

By July 10, Germany's free gold reserve had fallen to the equivalent of £35 million pounds, and  
all the Bank was doing had produced precisely the effect it was hoped to avoid. Another loss of  
50 million gold marks was suffered during the week which ended on July 14 — the direct result  
of supporting the paper mark by rationing supplies of foreign currencies and having to cover  
indispensable imports from the gold reserve. If intervention continued at the then level of 10  
million gold marks daily, bankruptcy would come within 60 days: the reserves had already taken  
as much as they could stand. If intervention ceased, on the other hand, it was broadly expected  
that the dollar would go to a million marks, the pound to over 4 million — and by the end of July  
that expectation was fulfilled. Merchants were still said to be borrowing paper marks to the value

of 80 per cent of their stock, and exchanging them at the Bank for dollar Treasury bills needed  
ostensibly for imports. These bills were sent abroad to the merchants' buying agencies, and in  
most cases stayed there with no countervalue returning to Germany.

Complacency appears then to have crept into the government's financial thinking. The Finance  
Under-Secretary, Herr Schroeder, for example, referring to the 8,000 milliard marks discounted  
in June opined that it only represented £10 million sterling, which was hardly excessive seeing  
that the country was in a state of war. The Reichsbank nevertheless eyed the disappearance of its  
remaining resources with dismay. On July 19 it suddenly suspended the discounting of trade  
paper and refused to sacrifice any more of the gold reserve. The ordinary import trade promptly  
came to a standstill, and it became very hard for the Government to finance the import of coal  
and food — the coal desperately needed to keep the railways going.

The Bank's decision was in part a panic measure. Demands upon it from other banks had  
amounted that day to a sum equalling the entire paper circulation in the country. The manager of  
the Exchange Department produced only one quarter per cent of the total, which the banks  
rejected as inadequate. Two days later, the Reichsbank relented to the extent of issuing 5, per  
cent of the demand — but also resumed discounting interior trade bills; and at the end of July the  
Reichsbank had only £25 million in gold left. Attempts by the government to raise a loan abroad,  
in the first instance in London, to cover necessary imports were met with the old response that  
nothing would be available until Germany's finances had been put in order.

A number of diverging, often conflicting, tendencies were noted throughout Germany at this  
time, as bewilderment and depression afflicted everyone from government and business circles,  
who might have been expected to know what was going on, to the wage earners and clerical  
classes, who had no idea whatever. On the one hand, among the lower German officials who had  
always been intensely loyal to the government, mainly because their own fortunes were  
intimately linked to those of the country, an extremely nationalist spirit had developed. It had  
become and now remained politically impossible for the government — any government — to  
consider giving up passive resistance in the Ruhr. On the other hand, in the country at large, the  
coalition was losing support in every other way very rapidly. The leading Centre newspaper,  
Germania, announced on July 27 that confidence in the administration was 'now completely  
shattered', that ariger was universal, and that 'the general feeling is that of the Ninth of  
November' (the day the Republic was proclaimed in 1918).

The Wirth government was accused of wobbling \[Germania said\] but the Cuno government  
makes no movement at all. They stand still. Beyond a few ordinances, such as controlling the  
consumption of meat in restaurants, and occasional speeches, they remain passive ... The huge  
sums required for passive resistance were provided by the printing press ... Credits were issued  
to industrial circles, and it is not known to what extent they were used for hoarding foreign bills  
...

The policy of fulfilment was only partly responsible. People abroad lo'st confidence when they  
realised that the authority of the State was being undermined in Germany itself. The first  
symptom was the murder of Rathenau. The real collapse of our currency began when it became  
evident that certain industrial circles were more powerful than the government.

In the meantime the working population were losing their patience. The withdrawal of the 1,000  
mark note, although worth barely one-third of a penny at the beginning of July, had been an  
unhappy loss. The highest denomination as long before as 1876 and thus an old friend, its issue  
was repudiated, it appears, because rumours were circulating that it might be revalorised at its  
old gold rate. In practice, it also disappeared because (as Dr Schacht put it) in order to produce  
low-currency notes far more working time was required by paper-makers, engineers, printers,  
lithographers, colour experts and packers than was represented by the value of the finished  
article. In the fourth week of July the German nation was introduced to a new range of banknotes  
of which the three highest denominations were now 10, 20 and 50 million marks.

The workers responded in the only way they could, demanding npt only higher wages but daily  
payment so that their income would keep its spending power long enough to get rid of it. The  
demands were enforced with repeated strikes, disorders and demonstrations in all parts of the  
country. The possibility of civil war was openly discussed in the press, and frenziedly denied by  
the government. A thousand arrests were made after riots and plundering on July 20 and \*\*\* si i  
in Breslau, where organised bands of Cqmmunists prowled through the streets. July 24 produced  
demonstrations against profiteering, capitalism and Fascism in Frankfort, where inoffensive  
citizens were molested, windows were broken, and one man kicked to death. Open air meetings  
were forbidden in Berlin, but 10,000 demonstrated peaceably enough in Leipzig, and 5,000 in  
Dresden. In the last week of July demonstrators were killed in the Bavarian town of Rosenheim,  
and in Potsdam. There were ship-building strikes in Hamburg and a pilots' strike in the Kiel  
canal.

The same pattern was to continue through August, when armed strikers were to kill police at  
Wilhelmsburg and throw them into the water at Hamburg — all in aid of a basic wage which was  
inevitably put of date by the time it was negotiated and paid. Some of the troubles were  
Communist inspired, others not particularly so. In 1922 the Third International had laid down  
that policy in Germany was to be restricted to gaining influence with the workers by exploiting  
their serious economic situation. In May 1923 a rising in the Ruhr had been considered again, but  
in general now it was felt that the time was not yet.

As they discovered that a stable purchasing power for wages became less and less attainable,  
union leaders began to demand that wages be fixed on a gold basis. That, however, all agreed,  
could scarcely be done before a gold standard was adopted equally by trade and finance. An  
agreement was thus struck at the beginning of July between the Minister of Finance and a  
representative trade union committee to relate wages by indexation to the cost of living. Its  
principle was a weekly wage adjustment (as well as daily payments) to maintain value — the  
adjustment applying equally to the 'efficiency' wage (Leistungslohri) as to the 'social' wage  
(Soziallohri) which covered such matters as extra-family allowances. The negotiation of real  
wages (Reallohri), that is to say increased payments on the basis of the gold mark, was to be  
regarded as something quite separate.

In practice, as the government was aware, rises in wages — and government salaries — would  
always be 15 days in arrears of the rise in the cost of living, for the new adaptations would be  
received at the end of each 15-day wage period, the basic wage having been received at the start:  
a device which meant a great saving to the Exchequer as, in each successive week of July, the  
mark's rate against the pound mounted startlingly from 800,000 (July 7) to 900,000 (July 14)

1,600,000 (July 23) to 5,000,000, or 21 million to the dollar, on the last day of the month, and as  
prices moved upwards in step.

What Lord Curzon described as 'this extraordinary and almost incredible fall in the value of the  
mark,' which brought on an acute food crisis in Germany, also brought the German Ambassador  
in London, cap in hand, to see him at the Foreign Office. There he was pressed by the  
ambassador to use his influence to secure the long-requested loan to pay for Germany's essential  
fuel and food imports. As France was still titularly Britain's ally, Curzon for the present was  
unable to accede, and confined his refusal to asking whether it was the intention that the  
Reichsbank's printing presses would cease work. To that, and to the question of why the latest  
tax measures had not been tried before, the unfortunate ambassador had no answer. He delivered  
a memorandum to Curzon, however, couched in terms which Germania might well have  
approved:

It is an ominous sign that the mark following its latest tremendous collapse \[nach ihrem letzen  
ungeheuren Sturz\] is now beginning to lose its purchasing power in internal trade also. At the  
same time the Reichsbank no longer has sufficient foreign currency to make it possible for  
industry and for the State to procure abroad the necessities of life, especially coal and food. The  
dreary foreign outlook together with the destruction of the currency and the resulting chaos in the  
whole economic structure have produced the result that the population are beginning to lose  
confidence in the State and in themselves. Distrust of the depreciating currency is driving goods  
from the market, while the late harvest has produced an exceptionally alarming scarcity of  
foodstuffs in the towns, especially Berlin. The desperation of the masses is being exploited by  
radical agitators from both Left and Right ...

In fact, the wheat crop had been rather a good one, especially in Saxony, and the scarcity was  
caused by the farmers' refusal to accept paper in return for their produce. However, while the  
government's only policy was to borrow at the maximum rate to pay wages in the Ruhr, and  
while the independent Reichsbank added fuel to the flames of this folly (for Dr Havenstein and  
the Bank's directorate were if anything more wrong-headed in these matters than the  
government), no loan was possible: Britain, for one, had already been stung early the year before  
by agreeing to part with £12 million to aid an equally profligate Austria. The phenomenal fall of  
the mark in the last days of July certainly caused grave embarrassment to the government. The  
German Ambassador's complaint that the mark was losing its internal purchasing power, though  
heard so often for many months, was becoming ever more real. For the present, however, traders'  
disclination to accept Reichsbanknotes could still theoretically be countered by multiplying both  
their quantity and their denominations. In practice, it was harder than ever to supply the banks  
with enough money to allow business to proceed on traditional lines. From Dresden to Coblenz,  
at the end of July, the 'new high denomination notes were awaited anxiously.

Between July 11 and July 20,. the floating debt increased from 28,000 milliard marks to 40, 000  
milliard, a daily issue, excluding Sundays, of 2,000 milliards. The taxation system had entirely  
broken down. LivingJrom day to day, the government did not seem to care. Of the expenditure  
during those few days of 12,000 milliard marks, only 4 per cent was found from taxation — at  
just over 500 milliards not even enough to cover the interest (570 milliards) on the debt for the  
same period.

These appalling figures were no more than a foretaste of the chaos of the following weeks."The  
Ruhr railways, which had once provided a third of Germany's: revenue from the Ruhr, now  
accounted for one-fifth of her outgoings, in wages and compensation. 'Wir schiessen,' a high  
financial official told the British Ambassador, 'dieselben Bocke wie die Osterreicher'-- (,'We  
shoot the same goats as the Austrians'). Between August 1 and August 10, the records show, the  
floating debt almost doubled. But during those latter ten days, the government's general  
administrative expenditure rose to 40,000 milliards: a sum somewhat greater than the total  
nominal expenditure during the first four months of the year.

Although Austria's goats has become a very different breed since the previous autumn when Dr  
Zimmermann took over financial control and the Geneva Protocols had been approved by the  
National Assembly, Germany might well look on her neighbour with awe. That unhappy country  
was undergoing for all to see the full throes of the exorcism of the devil of inflation, and it was  
plainly the most unpleasant process.

That the necessary reforms could not be achieved without hardship and sacrifice had been made  
clear to the 'people at Christmas time. What they had not been told, and were now finding out,  
was that the victims of the recovery would be hardly less unfairly selected than those of the  
inflation. In August 1922, the official dole figure (which, as in Germany, substantially  
underestimated the real unemployment figure and ignored short-time working) had been 21,000.  
In the five months from October 1922 until February 1922, the figure rose successively from  
38,000 58,000, 83,000, 117,000 and 161,000. In every case, well over half the workless were in  
Vienna itself, which in February meant more than 100,000 idle men receiving for themselves and  
their families a maximum dole of 87,360 paper kronen, worth about 55. a week. It was a  
dangerous concentration, though embracing both working and official classes, in a city still  
politically divided, where the class war was still 'the popular topic.

In Austria as a whole, about one-fifth of the population depended on government money for their  
salaries or (if retired) for their pensions, the railways having two ex-employee pensioners for  
every three workers still on their staff. Although the deadwood on the railways was not properly  
cut away until towards the end of 1923 under external guidance,\* (\*Sir William Acworth, chosen  
as technical adviser for the railways, presented his report in November 1923 and recommended  
that one man out of four should be dispensed with.) and although railway finances represented  
the crux of the budgetary deficit, other essential economies, planned or forced, had started at  
once in both the public and private sectors, with redundancies and dismissals occurring in both.  
Stabilisation had brought the Austrian manufacturer face to face with reality, and serious  
industrial depression was setting in, stagnation affecting the iron, wood, paper and leather  
industries and the manufacture of metal, machinery, shoes and furniture. The first bankruptcies  
of businesses spawned by the inflation were beginning. Elsewhere concealed overstaffing was  
coming to light: in January 1923 the leading Vienna banks had one official for every £2,000 of  
their total reserves and deposits, compared with one for every £18,000 in London. This situation  
was partly due to the compulsory extra work the banks had to do to help the foreign exchange  
office and the tax authorities, but the banks were also finding it impossible to administer except  
at prohibitive cost the great number of smaller, older accounts which inflation had reduced to the  
value of a few pre-war pfennigs, and in some cases to less than the value of the paper they had to  
be written down on. Savings banks catering for the small saver and hoping to restore his  
confidence were particularly badly affected in this respect.

Dismissals in the public sector were governed by the public expenditure cuts called for by Dr  
Zimmermann's office. Generally they came in the wake of the sackings in private industry, the  
government being slow to implement the directives it received. It was noted, however, that those  
who were at last axed were first and foremost those with no political connections. One  
unfortunate consequence of this was that, by the end of 1923, administrative efficiency had  
seriously declined, for the civil service was hardly less overmanned than the railways, and the  
senior, more experienced civil servantifwere those who had traditionally kept politics at arm's  
length.

From March onwards, however, the economic and financial picture began to look better from the  
point of view of Austria's spon-"sors. Unemployment which reached nearly 170,000 that month  
began to fall substantially and regularly, dropping in August to as low as 84,000 (53,000 of  
whom were in Vienna). The krone remained rock-steady, and the fact that for the best part of a  
year it had already:,been more stable against the dollar than, any other currency in Europe was a  
solid foundationdfor confidence. Deposits were accumulating in the savings banks. When the  
long-term international loan was at last floated on June 1 1923, it was a huge and immediate  
success. Austria's budget was to be balanced ahead of the Zimmermann schedule, and the whole  
loan was never called up. The striking increase in demand for Austrian stocks and shares, whose  
index had doubled between December 1922 and the following May and increased by 400 per  
cent in the course of the year, was a development which reflected general confidence more than  
it brought great tangible benefit to the economy: speculation in undervalued shares absorbed a  
great deal of domestic capital which might have been put to productive purposes.

The lowest point which Austria's official unemployed figure reached was the 79,000  
of'November 1923, still nearly four times the number before stabilisation. After November, the  
number of planned redundancies in the civil service, in the Volkswehr, the postal services and  
the railways began to have a real impact upon the labour position. The comparatively promising  
situation in the middle of 1923 was in large part owing to the increase in Austrian trade arising  
from the Ruhrkampf: foreign orders for certain goods were switched from Germany to Austria,  
where even a little of Germany's business would go a long way.

The dismissal of more than 23,000 officials from the State service between October and  
December 1923 was to be a much truer gauge of the belt-tightening that was taking place. Strikes  
were few — but that was because a strike policy, with or without union support, was so  
obviously suicidal when everyone was losing jobs and employees could be easily and cheaply  
replaced. The official target, after all, was a cut of 100,000 State jobs by the end of 1924, and the  
unions were well aware that in the autumn of 1923 the programme of reduction of government  
officials was falling badly behind.'

It was doubtless satisfactory that foreign confidence had returned in such full measure to this  
European financial oasis maintained and guaranteed by the Allies; and that Austria's economy,  
public and private, was obviously reorganising along the correct lines. Yet, they were hardly  
considerations which allowed, the Austrian people much scope for rejoicing, greatly as the  
general atmosphere of uncertainty and gloom of 1922 had improved. From January 1923  
onwards and as the Ruhrkampf had its effect on the European economy, the cost of living began  
to creep upwards again and continued to do so throughout the year, adding 3 per cent in August  
alone. Although by December 1923 it only attained once more the previous highest level of

September 1922 (after which there had come the 20 per cent drop), the rise took place in the face  
of higher taxes which more people than ever before had to pay. The government found it  
particularly unfortunate that prices (in line with world prices) went on rising while the necessary  
reforms and reductions were taking place; and as early as May, indeed, questioned whether it  
was possible at all to maintain law and order at the same time as budgetary equilibrium.

Perhaps it was not surprising, therefore, that the workers persisted in opposing the abolition of  
the index system under which wjiges could not be reduced until the index had fallen in two  
consecutive months. The factory worker was now relatively better off than most, and in some  
cases better off than he had been before the war, notwithstanding that wages were lower than  
anywhere else in Europe except Germany. In a country which had a great excess of educated  
men, the difference in average rewards between manual and intellectual workers had become  
very small, and the wages of a skilled mechanic often exceeded those of a factory manager, who  
himself received many times those of a government official.

The financial picture was sound. The economy was improving? But the social picture was far  
from happy. The classes who had already endured so much well understood that a far harder time  
might be on the way. Those whom the index had to some extent protected began to experience  
chiller winds than they had known possible, in some degree because until stabilisation they  
hardly knew how poor they had become. The days of subsidies and doles were over. People who  
had no work were more penurious than ever, spending their time searching notice-boards and  
newspapers for jobs which did not exist. State officials who remained on the national pay-roll  
found that on average in 1923 they received one-quarter of their 1914 spending power. State  
pensioners received one-third in real terms of what had been little enough before the war.

In Vienna most people lived in flats, for only the very rich had houses which they could afford to  
keep in repair. Because rents were kept so low (rent restriction is habitually one of the first and  
cheapest of government devices to re-strain the cost of living under inflation) flats themselves'  
were in short supply. Even had the Viennese municipality been well-disposed towards the  
landlord, it could not have been ignored that most of the middle class would have been entirely  
unable to afford economic rents of up to 20,000 times the pre-war figure. Though unable to raise  
their rents, many landlords at least had the consolation that their own mortgage payments were  
no more than a nominal burden to them — a consideration which had long since dismayed the  
depositors and share-holders of the mortgage banks. Under such circumstances, however, no new  
buildings at all were being put up by private developers, most of whom had been virtually  
expropriated. More than 42,000 families were waiting for the 6,000 or so dwellings which the  
local authorities built in Vienna each year. This shortage land the regulation whereby the local  
authorities, not the landlords, decided who would go into any flat which became empty, led to a  
great deal of jobbing and corruption in an area where it was already rife.

The period of Austrian rehabilitation, of heavy taxation and drastic cuts in public spending, was  
one of great popular suffering, of continuing class and group hatred, and of political struggle.  
The State and the municipal government of Vienna appeared to compete to tax Austrian industry,  
so much of which was centred on the capital, to the utmost — the State in order to be able to  
repay the interest on foreign loans, the latter (whose activities were free from League control) in  
order "to pursue the interests of its political supporters in the working classes. Whether or not  
thex-charge was just that the Socialists controlling Vienna did little more than hang doctrinaire

reforms around the Republic's neck — 'actively concerned in the pleasing process', Germains  
wrote, 'of converting middle-class incomes into doles for the workers', there is no doubt that  
party politics continued to rend the country in two when unity was the crying need.

Austria's reconstruction was compared to the experiment made by the gipsy to teach his horse to  
do without food. When he got it down to a straw a day, the horse died.

### 10: Summer of '23

AT THE end of July 1923 German shares had established themselves as a popular though  
unstable repository of wealth. In general, shareholders were a good deal poorer than they  
thought, the fact of impoverishment having been largely veiled by the gigantic increases in  
nominal prices. Speculation kept all shares at a high level above their interest-return value, even  
given that dividends were still being held artificially low to avoid income tax. A Deutsche Bank  
share cost £114. just before the war and yielded £6 55; but in 1923 cost £5 and yielded a  
farthing. A share in Siemens and Helske, £101 pre-war and paying £6, now stood at £23 and paid  
2d. Thus capital values, low as they had come, had not fallen to the same extent as dividends  
which were proportionately even lower than in 1922. At the annual general meeting of one large  
bank, an American shareholder complained that the dividend on his holding was barely worth  
fetching away, not merely because its value was so small but because of the high cost of  
transport for the volume of notes required.

Anyone who during the first six months of the year had sought a haven for money in domestic  
shares would at least have lost little of it. in real terms. The total value of German company  
shares quoted in Berlin, though at a paltry £89 million in December 1922, was three times as  
great — at .£271 million — in July 1923. This must have been a comfort to any who could  
overlook the comparison with the pre-war total of £1,767 million,, or the £600 million in July

1921.  The price (in terms of the dollar) of a number of so-called 'undiluted' shares in the first few  
    months of 1923 was actually twice as high as during the previous October, their all-time low. At  
    that point, in terms of the paper mark the dollar had riseri, 1,525 times, but nominal share prices  
    had increased only, 89 times. In fact from October 1922 onwards it was possible by choosing  
    investments carefully actually to increase one's real capital substantially: by July 1923 the  
    average portfolio would have risen sixteen times, by September twenty-three times and by  
    October twenty-eight times in terms of gold.

The year's performance of the markets, albeit at a level far below pre-war, more or less  
complemented the hideous bear market of 1922. The fall and the climb, on the other hand,  
mirrored the availability of foreign currency as a means of holding real value, and the severe  
volatility of the market at all times made rational investment judgments extremely difficult.  
During the Ruhrkampf, moreover, an enormous number of the buying orders came from the  
occupied territories — backed by the very subsidies which the government was paying in order  
to keep passive resistance going. Many investors were dealt heavy losses because of the wild  
swings in market prices: others, equally, made large chance profits. The effects of inflation upon  
share prices generally caused immense shifts in the distribution of wealth among a now large  
share-holding community, and contributed to the rancour and demoralisation of the nation at  
large. Many who would have dearly liked to buy industrial shares when they were still absurdly  
cheap were unable to for want of money.\* (\*For further and deeper discussion of shares under  
inflation see Bresciani-Turroni, The Economics of Inflation (originally Le Vicende del Marco  
Tedesco 1931) pp 253-285.)

Not only were individuals induced by the harshness of their circumstances to look after  
themselves. As the nation moved swiftly towards chaos every community from the states  
downwards began to look narrowly at its priorities. In East Prussia, for example, seeing from a

distance the imminent collapse of central Germany, the businessmen and landowners of  
Konigsberg sought to secure a backdoor for their exports. In this outwardly prosperous district,  
the ruling class were reported to be quite prepared to leave the ship for another refuge if it sank,  
and even to leave central Germany to starve if it could provide no market for agricultural  
produce.

East Prussia still enjoyed full employment. In spite of the steps they were now taking to  
safeguard the future, it was notable that the rich of the state had contributed generously towards  
the Ruhrspende — the fund to support the struggle against France, The isolation produced by the  
Treaty of Versailles, cutting the area off from Germany proper, had led to the revival of many  
industries, and latterly an electricity station had been built to cope with the coal shortage.  
Characteristically, Stinnes had bought up nearly all the shipbuilding yards, and cellulose and  
paper mills in East Prussia, and other investors were following his lead,

Prosperity, however, was confined as elsewhere to those in a position to benefit from the  
production of saleable goods. The editor of the Konigsberger Volkszeitung claimed that there  
were working-class quarters in 'the area 'the condition of whose denizens compared unfavourably  
with what he had seen of the fellahin of Egypt.' As ever, the lower middle class were suffering  
tragically, and in July four-fifths of the 60,000 persons in Konigsberg dependent on public  
support were petits bourgeois attempting to live on their savings. A schoolmaster at Insterburg,  
interviewed by an Allied observer, said that 70 per cent of East Prussia's schoolchildren were  
under observation for tuberculosis, adding darkly that 'the sight of food destroys the reason of  
starving people.'

Saxony was in a politically more dangerous condition. Communism was strong, and the Socialist  
Prime Minister, Dr Zeigner, had bought the support of nine Communist deputies in order to  
retain his power in the Landtag. Here there had appeared the first of the Red Centuries — the  
Rote Hundertschaften, those organised bodies of Socialist workmen, Soviet agents among them,  
whose overt purpose was to supplement the police. What they lacked in firepower they made up  
for in numbers:' probably 30,000 strong in Saxony to the 11,500 in the police force. They were a  
dangerous development from a national point of view, although many saw them as an element to  
neutralise the equally sombre expansion of reactionary societies. Basically, however, they were  
combustible material, the more so because Saxon factories — as everywhere else — were now  
pricing themselves out of business. Severe reduction in foreign orders and the necessary  
curtailment of output were leading to short-time working and unemployment.

The near-stoppage of foreign trade in the middle of the summer affected Germany's trading  
partners in varying degree. The Board of Trade in London had already recorded the impossibility  
of doing business directly with Germany. Now the Dutch, the Italians and the Austrians (still  
struggling to their feet) began to prepare grimly for the political and economic collapse of their  
common neighbour. Belgium worried intensely about the transit trade via Antwerp in respect of  
both railways and waterways. Early in August, reparation deliveries in kind ceased even to non-  
invading members of the Entente. The upheavalLin trade and the supply of raw materials  
throughout the Continent appeared to all to be unending.

Of all Germany, naturally enough, conditions in the Ruhr and the Rhineland at the beginning of  
August were most challenging. M. Poincare might require French newspapers to refrain from

assisting the disintegration of this area by publishing articles in favour of a Rhenish republic, but  
France did all she could to break the spirit of passive resistance by persuading German workers  
in the areas she occupied either away from Germany or back to work. The Ruhr, indeed was a  
sorry sight, a picture of economic stagnation. The only trains which ran were the military ones,  
shunting aimlessly up and down. Canals and inland harbours were blocked with all types of  
vessels, unable and unwilling to move. Postal and telegraphic services were hopelessly impeded,  
and telephones were cut off. Few cars circulated and it was hard for anyone to get about, travel  
difficulties rousing ugly passions in all. The coal being produced by the summer was a fraction  
of the normal, and now the French, who had cleared the pithead stocks and sent them to France  
by rail, had located the steel industry's coal stocks by spotter aircraft and were starting on those.  
The Ruhr's blast furnaces had mostly been damped down, and steel production was minimal.  
Lack of coke had reduced the output of iron and steel to one-fifth of its 1922 rate,

In the occupied areas, in and outside the Ruhr, law and order became1 a fragile commodity. The  
mark, at 5 million to the pound on July 31, stood at 16 million on August 7. For the next eight  
days the frontier with unoccupied Germany was closed as a reprisal, General Degoutte  
announced, for the recent bomb outrages in Düsseldorf. Reprisal or not, it was also part of the  
French policy to weaken resistance by holding up the import of money supplies, a practice which  
was correspondingly more effective the more sharply the cost of living rose. The policy was not  
unsuccessful, for the Ruhr miners and railway workers in particular were reported to be offering  
to co-operate if no wages were forthcoming from their nominal employers. However, the more  
immediate result was to turn the populace against authority of all kind; and the unavailability of  
currency drove frantic not only the Ruhr workless for whom the dole, now at 2 million marks a  
day, was barely adequate, but the workers who struggled ineffectually throughout the rest of —  
the occupied areas to bring home a living wage.

In the Belgian zone pillaging of crops threatened the harvest. West of Cologne, where looting,  
strikes and riots were increasing day by day, huge bands of protesters took to roving the  
countryside destroying crops and farm buildings. At Aachen, 12 demonstrators were killed and  
80 wounded in local disorders arising from wage demands. The brown-coal miners of Bergheim  
(in the British zone) went on prolonged strike after a succession of wild-cat stoppages and threats  
to burn factories and smash machinery. Police had to disperse 3,000 paper workers at Mulheim,  
and a mob of unemployed at Solingen raided the market and forced dealers to reduce potato  
prices by half. The fire-brigade at Leverkusen were locked up by a band of Communists. And at  
Gelsenkirchen, near Essen in the Ruhr, where Chancellor Cuno and Hugo Stinnes were hanged  
in effigy, a full-blooded riot developed in the town after the local police force had been  
surrounded and attacked, with two more deaths recorded.

On August 10, on which date a printers' strike broke out to the further interruption of the supply  
of banknotes, the full weight of the shortage of paper money was felt. Stocks of food disappeared  
entirely in many communities, and factories were able to pay wages on account only. The  
railway workers in the British zone, with a wage tariff half that of factory workers, attempted to  
join the passive resisters of the Ruhr, and asked pathetically whether, if they were not allowed to  
strike, they could at least be guaranteed by the occupation authorities enough food at fixed prices  
as well as the money to buy it.

At Coblenz 300 milliard marks were needed immediately for the weekend payments so that riots  
and bloodshed could be avoided. Lord Kilmarnock, at Coblenz, did his best to persuade Degoutte  
to relax his control of the frontier; but the French, strongly suspecting that the Ruhr strikes were  
mainly financed from the British zone, argued that it was unreasonable for Coblenz and Cologne  
to receive supplies of marks while the German government refused to supply any for the use of  
the French and Belgian armies. In this, French suspicions were probably justified, because for  
three weeks Berlin had systematically been transporting paper marks to Cologne via Amsterdam  
and Croydon in order to avoid levies and confiscations at the frontiers of French-occupied  
territory. That innovation came to the notice of the Foreign Office in London because the  
Croydon Customs Office required guidance as to whether the packages of banknotes which  
accompanied the Rekhsbank's representative Herr Heinrich Schlinkmeier, a quarter of a ton at a  
time, should be classified as merchandise or personal effects. The traffic in fact continued until  
the end of passive resistance, and in the meantime General Degoutte was instructed by Paris to  
allow money supplies into Cologne.

In the British zone things then began to look up in respect of currency. The Reichsbank promised  
to print locally a million notes a day, each worth a million marks. 'This should render our zone-  
independent of supplies from outside,' telegrammed Lord Kilmar-nock on August 13 in a  
misplaced burst of optimism1 (for within a month the million-mark note would be worth a  
ha'penny), 'and should enable the bank to constitute a reserve against the possible future fall of  
the mark.'

The local authorities, Cologne and Coblenz included, still did their best to make up for the  
shortfall in supplies by printing their own currency, but were now finding that the large  
industrialists were unwilling to give them credits. Friction increased rapidly in local politics,  
encouraging workers to demand wages geared to notional future values of the mark. The dockers  
of Bremen were making a bid for wages related to the price of gold. The rioters of Hamburg,  
where public assembly was forbidden in vain, demanded a base wage of 4.65 million marks  
(about 7 shillings) a day. On August 13, a Monday, most firms gave rises to their employees  
ranging from 5 million to 15 million marks a week; but the bulk of the wages had to be paid by  
cheque leaving an average of only 5 million (6 shillings) in cash. Cheques took longer to dispose  
of than cash; and on August 14 the employees of Wupperman surrounded that firm's directors'  
houses demanding 50 million marks (£3) per head immediately, while a crowd of 10,000 made  
the same demands from Bayer. Within the week police in Cologne were assaulted with iron bars  
and stones, mobs were patrolling the streets in Wiesdorf, Qhligs and Hilden, and tremendous  
unemployment was setting in. 'Meanwhile, back in Berlin, far from the bitterness of the Ruhr and  
the Rhineland, life was scarcely any better. The political crisis '"had come to a head. When the  
printers' strike broke out, large crowds furnished with baskets and wheelbarrows surrounded the  
Reichsbank head office calling angrily for banknotes. There was growing fear of new  
disturbances in all parts of the country if wages could not be paid, for it was no longer a question  
anywhere of meeting a weekly deadline, but a daily one. For a fortnight Berlin had been like a  
beseiged city, the country districts having practically stopped all supplies of meat, eggs and  
vegetables to the capital. All that could be said about the currency was that it Was still current,  
nothing having replaced it: but it was no serious measure of value, and hardly a medium of  
exchange.

The complications of daily life in the city by this time were such as to require an extended  
mathematical knowledge merely to keep body and soul together. In the press each morning  
would be published a list of the day's prices:

```
 Tramway fare 50,000
```

```
 Tramway monthly season ticket for one line 4 million
```

```
 for all lines 12 million
```

```
 Taxi-autos: multiply ordinary fare by 600,000
```

```
 Horse cabs: multiply ordinary fare by 1,400,000
```

```
 Bookshops: multiply ordinary price by 300,000
```

```
 Public baths: multiply ordinary price by 115,000
```

```
 Medical attendance: multiply ordinary price by 80,000
```

There was a different index or multiplier for every trade and for every class of goods in each  
trade. The most ordinary purchase in a shop demanded three or four minutes of calculation, and  
when the price had been ascertained several more minutes were usually needed to count out the  
notes in payment. The queues grew longer and longer. Lord D'Abernon wrote: It is hardly to be  
wondered that a great deal of discontent prevails. It is vexatious enough for a foreigner to be  
asked for a green fee at the golf course of one million marks, but he can console himself that in  
his case it amounts to about a shilling. The unfortunate housewife charged similar rates for  
household articles can make no such reflection. To boot, she has to stand in a queue for several  
hours to get some articles like butter.

The government, ever desperate to make sense of taxation and to drain back into the Exchequer  
the paper marks — 'Havenstein roubles', as they were called — which the Reichsbank poured  
forth (so that the need to print would diminish), tried all it knew. The struggle in the West had to  
go on, and the 'Rhein-Ruhr Opfer' (or sacrifice) was instituted to oblige income tax payers to  
make it possible. The new tax was based on 1922 assessments multiplied fiftyfold for the first  
payment and by much more for the two subsequent payments. It devolved principally on trade,  
industry and farming, but anyone earning more than a milliard marks a-year (say, £150) or  
owning a motor-car had to pay it — the latter at 50 times the automobile tax. By August 14  
depreciation was so great that the old multipliers of 25 and 35 applying to pre-paid tax were out  
of date, and even the new proposals for raising income and company taxes respectively by 100  
and 140 times had to be super-ceded. Three days later still, it was decided that corporation tax  
would have to be raised 600 times. Even had these taxes worked, they would not have reduced  
the budget imbalance by more than half.

The problems of indexation and under-charging were equally evident in the postal services,  
which were notoriously used to camouflage unemployment. Although Treasury officials freely  
admitted that the service would work much better if half the employees were dismissed, there  
was no political possibility of such a measure. The post office fell back on raising the tariff rates

from the derisory to the inadequate: letters were now to cost 400 marks (one-eighth of a penny)  
for inland postage and 1,000 marks for foreign. The expected postal deficit would still be nearly  
6,000 milliards. So with the railways, whose administration for four months had failed to adjust  
prices to the fall of the mark. When first and second class fares rose by 300 per cent on August 1,  
third and fourth class fares by 250 per cent, and freight charges by 150 per cent, the public outcry  
was mpre remarkable than the returns. In fact in no government department was there any hope  
of balancing a budget while banknote-printing went on.

As the national debt doubled once again, a gold loan was projected (repayable at 50 per cent  
premium in 1935) with the express object of mopping up paper notes. It provided for two sorts of  
investors, the parent who wished to leave something for his children, and the entrepreneur who  
wanted to keep working capital in stable form. Although this measurexwas briefly hailed as the  
first serious attack on the printing press, it was as much use as a broom for keeping back the tide.  
The Reichsbank was unstoppable. Whole denominations ofmark notes were worthless almost on  
leaving the presses. The entire currency of the country as autumn came had to be renewed again  
and again, whenever the price of a single tram fare — typical of the value of the lowest unit in  
circulation — soared on its unflagging upward career. Even from this point of view the policy of  
inflation must have been a most costly business.

The incapacity of the Bank's directorate at this stage passed the belief of many. On August 3,  
1923, observing as though for the first time that the market rate on loan money was .1. per cent a  
day, the president raised the Bank's discount rate from 18 to 30 per cent per annum and on loans  
from 19 to 31 per cent. The move, against the advice of the Bank's central committee who  
considered that it was truckling to market conditions, was however insisted upon by Dr  
Havenstein's fellow directors; and Havenstein himself opined that it was the Reichsbank's duty  
not to make rates of interest but to follow them. Had he meant — or at least understood — what  
he was saying, he should have set the Bank rate at 360 per cent, for even the 3 to 4 per cent a  
week pertaining to current accounts represented 200 per cent a year. The new rate had no impact  
whatever.

In an atmosphere of gathering fury and frustration, and with attacks on the Reichsbank's policy  
being launched from all sides, Dr Havenstein plunged on. Day and night 30 paper mills, 150  
printing firms and 2,000 printing presses toiled away adding perpetually to the bli">ard of  
banknotes under which the country's economy had already disappeared. Havenstein spoke of the  
efficiency — the Leistungsfahigkeit — of his printing system, and saw the greatest inflationary  
danger in the private state banks who were permitted to issue up to 15,000 milliard marks not  
daily, as the Reichsbank was doing every day of the week except Sundays, but as a once-and-for-  
all legal limit, and who were demanding the right to print more. This, he said, proclaiming once  
more his mission to relieve Germany of its dearth of currency, would 'render nugatory the whole  
credit policy of the Reich and of the Reichsbank'.

The strain of Havenstein and the Ruhrkampf together was more than the government could take.  
Dr Cuno's future was already in doubt when the mark's precipitous slide at the beginning of  
August began. Without a loan from abroad, with a supplementary estimate before the Cabinet for  
6,000 milliard marks (about £400,000) because of the Ruhr subvention, and knowing that to end  
passive resistance would mean not only political death but probably physical death as well, the  
coalition began to founder. 'It is not a choice between capitulation "and chaos,' explained the

Foreign Minister, Dr Rosenberg. 'Capitulation would mean chaos. If things go on much longer  
without relief, we shall have chaos without capitulation. It comes to this: the alternative is chaos  
with honour or chaos with dishonour ...'

Despair, indeed, was consuming Germany. It was believed that the disturbances in the Ruhr and  
the Rhineland might lead to the French marching upon Berlin; and the French did not discourage  
such talk. Violent Communist-led outbreaks were occurring in Saxony and Thuringia, and. the  
reactionary movement under Hitler in Bavaria was palpably growing in strength and size. On  
August 8 in a speech to the Reichstag largely inaudible because of the noise by Communist  
deputies, Dr Cuno warned that imports would now have to be curtailed more than ever, that  
taxation would be 'unrelenting', and that national unity was needed as never before. Although the  
feature of this sitting was the hostility shown between the Communists and the Majority  
Socialists, together with the increased insolence of the former towards everyone, the Chancellor  
was heard in silence at last as he claimed that the seven months of passive resistance in the Ruhr  
had shown to the world that Germany was worthy of respect. The house listened with approval to  
his call for the fight to be carried on; but it was Cuno's last effort. He had the air more and more  
of a scapegoat.

In an avalanche of paper marks, and crashing exchange rates, under the threat of a general strike,  
in the universal misunderstanding of a Note sent by Curzon stating more or less baldly that  
France had no right to be in the Ruhr, the Cuno Cabinet fell. It was replaced by that of Dr Gustav  
Stresemann, the leader of the constitutional, anti-socialist, businessman's Volkspartei.

### 11: Havenstein

THE new Chancellor's first action was tio publish Curzon's Note' and distribute it for all to read.  
The threatened general strike was cancelled and heart was almost instantly, put into the German  
people in regard to the Ruhrkampf. But Stresemann could not immediately win support from a  
nation unable to forget for an instant the financial anarchy in which they all lived. The Right,  
including some of the industrialists who had a marked aversion to taxation, began to suspect and  
accuse him of following a Socialist line. Disorderly sections of the people — the Communists  
and, in Bavaria especially, the 'patriotic' organisations — became less ruly than ever.

Fears grew, or were nourished, that Stresemann's appointment spelt an end to passive resistance  
and capitulation to the French, so that Hitler came within an ace of his aim of welding the forces  
of reaction into unity: the issue that now divided Munich was whether to shake Bavaria loose  
from Berlin or to march on the capital. By contrast, anti-Hitler Communist disturbances were  
launched in Stettin, Lübeck and other towns, and labour riots occurred all over Germany.

No situation, however, was so bad that summer that Dr Haven-stein could not make it worse.  
Nor was anyone in the government who ostensibly knew less about these things than he disposed  
to remonstrate with him, the guardian and leader of orthodox German financial opinion. He held  
firmly to his view that money supply was unconnected with either price levels or exchange rates;  
saw his duty as having to supply to the limit of his ability the medium of exchange for which,  
because of the mark's ever-tumbling purchasing power, his countrymen were crying out; and was  
spurred to renewed activity by the latest enormous price rises with which they were beset. The  
sheer logistics, not to speak of the incredible expense, of printing and distributing time and again  
the amounts with which he was dealing appeared to be his greatest worry: and although notes of  
adequate denomination were only transiently, available" these days, no one in the banking world  
or in the Reichstag ever suggested that someone else could have better mastered the difficulties  
of providing them.

The full enormity of Havenstein's policies was duly revealed in the speech he made — published  
immediately afterwards — to a Council of State on August 17. 'The Reichsbank,' he said, with  
evident pride and satisfaction, 'today issues 20,000 milliard marks of new money daily, of which  
5,000 milliards are in large denominations. In the next week the bank will have increased this to  
46,000 milliards daily, of which 18,000 milliards will be in large denominations. The total issue  
at present amounts to 63,000 milliards. In a few days we shall therefore be able to issue in one  
day two-thirds of the total circulation.'

How he would bring all this paper into circulation was the least of the questions raised.  
Havenstein had been completely unconscious of the disastrous effect his intended action and,  
even more, its proclamation, must have upon the mark's value, not to speak of the whole  
financial, trading and industrial structure of the country. Before he spoke the mark was at 3  
million to the dollar, 12.5 million to the pound (there had been a recent small improvement):  
within 48 hours it fell to 5.2 million to the dollar, 22 million to the pound. The circulation in  
August 1923 had an exchange value of £9m, less than one-thirtieth of what it had been ten years  
earlier, and no amount of printing contrived to increase its value by a penny. On the contrary, the

hole in the budget was getting bigger; but it was on this phenomenon that Dr Havenstein's beliefs  
about the relationship between money supply and prices were based.

'No one could anticipate such an ingenuous revelation of extreme folly to which ignorance and  
false theory could lead,' Lord D'Aber-non wrote to the Foreign Office. 'The Reichsbank's own  
demented inspirations give stabilisation no chance.' And in his diary he noted:

Forty-six billion marks \[12 noughts\] represent a1 face value of £2,300,000,000,000 and the note  
circulation £3,150,000,000,600 ... The Council of State is supposed to contain financial and  
economic experts, yet none criticised the policy stated or referred to its insanity. The speech was  
largely reproduced in the German press, and provoked neither outcry nor astonishment.

That was not quite true. Forward, of which Hilferding, Strese-mann's semi-enlightened Finance  
Minister, had been political editor until 1915, roundly accused Dr Havenstein xof spoiling the  
government's latest attempts to make paper marks scarce — not so much by printing marks as by  
allowing people to hold on to their foreign bills or, worse, by lending paper marks to them with  
which they could buy more foreign bills. Under the heading 'Havenstein the Eternal', Vorwdrts  
protested:

Germany is a Republic but the Reichsbank is a Monarchy 1 Wilhelm is in Doom: Havenstein is  
still in Berlin! He is here for life. He owes that to the Entente — it was an English delusion that  
the Reichsbank needed strengthening, that inflation was taking place against its will, that an  
autonomous Bank would refuse to discount Treasury bills. We need an Abdication Law for  
Havenstein!

The Chancellor seems to have been shocked by Havenstein's performance, but being, with  
Stinnes, who had greatly influenced him, an'inflator himself, he was clearly more taken aback by  
the fact of the publication of the speech than by its substance, whose stupefying purport he can  
hardly have grasped. The Socialists demanded Havenstein's dismissal, which was enough to  
make it politically impossible — and Havenstein's friends said that if he retired the chance of, a  
loan from London, where they believed he was respected, would go. In any case, if called to  
resign, Havenstein would have been within his rights in refusing.

In the cities, in the towns,,in the villages, Havenstein's voluminous, inadequate banknotes, far too  
many yet far too few, multiplied the already manifold difficulties of existence and drove people  
further to despair. In Berli'n the tramway system ceased to run through lack of means. In villages  
where no municipal or other emergency currency was available, a sudden drop in the value of the  
mark would leave the community with too little money to carry on at all: and in isolated villages  
this would occur without any warning. The sight of shoppers with baskets full of banknotes was  
now common in every town.

'You could see mail carriers in the streets with sacks on their backs or pushing baby carriages  
before them, loaded with paper money that would be devalued the next day,' said Erna von  
Pustau. 'Life was madness, nightmare, desperation, chaos.'

Owing to the shortage of banknotes, which continued in spite of the introduction on August 22 of  
thevfirst 100 million mark note, numerous firms had begun to issue illegal, unfunded emergency  
money without any Reichsbank guarantee: and much as Hayen-stein condemned what he called

'an important new source of inflation' which he was trying to stop, it was clear that the  
Reichsbank would always redeem them.

Statute books on taxation formed a mountain several feet high, and none could tell who was  
liable to pay what, when or to whom. The tax receipts for August, though nominally 98 times  
greater than in April, were in real terms worth half as much, for the mark had fallen 200 times in  
the same period. Thus between August 20 and 30 receipts represented 0,7 per cent of  
expenditure. It would in fact have made little difference by then had the tax system been capable  
even theoretically of meeting a budget whose balance was now continuously being violently  
upended: in human terms, the imposition of unpayable taxes to settle an impossible debt had at  
last destroyed tax morals at every level of society. The national unity of the spring had all but  
evaporated, and hardly anyone was willing any more to make sacrifices for the State.

The useless fight to remove Havenstein crackled on. The Berlin Borsen Courier called to  
Hilferding to show a strong hand, and wondered whether 'with his pliable Austrian manner' he  
would fill the role.

If the Geheimrats \[meaning, in this case, the senior officials of the Reichsbank\] want to dispose  
of the new Minister they know what they can do about it. First by giving him too many  
documents so that he is unable to ascertain the simple facts, and then by giving him too few in  
order that he may know nothing. The currency struggle is personified in the battle between  
Hilferding and Havenstein; and the struggle about the presidency of the Reichsbahk sums up the  
German situation today.

Did a Prussian estate owner like Havenstein understand, the newspaper inquired, that the  
German worker could starve? Or was there something more sinister than stupidity at work; was  
the aim to spread desperation through the masses, to destroy the Republic's authority, and to  
prepare the way for a dictatorship of the Right? The Stresemann government, the Courier  
thought, was the last effort to save Germany by legal parliamentary methods.

Hilferding made an important speech stating that the mark had to be stabilised, but admitted he  
could find no better way of meeting the situation than his predecessor, Hermes, had found-and  
the new gold loan was attracting few subscriptions. The Minister of the Interior attempted  
uselessly to draw up a budget on a gold basis on the ground that no one understood the meaning  
of the present figures which in any event were always changing.

On August 25, apparently because the imposition of the Rhine-Ruhr Opfer was obliging  
commerce to cash foreign currency holdings to pay it, the mark staged an abrupt recovery from  
25 million -to the pound to 12.5 million, so that for 48 hours real wages suddenly exceeded  
peace-time levels and prices of imported raw materials exceeded world prices; but the rally, long  
enough to throw the retail price system into complete confusion, was a mere flash in the pan.  
Havenstein, now on the defensive, insisted that inflation came not from granting credits but from  
what he called the boundless growth of the floating debt — which was to say he thought it was  
the government's fault. To the reproach that he had not refused to discount the government's  
bills, he replied that 'Even a threat by the Bank would have been a useless gesture,' adding that if  
the Bank's discount rate had been raised to meet the depreciation such a policy would have  
harmed all branches of industry -and would have had a 'catastrophic' effect, too, on prices.

Havenstein's speech, made in the closing days of August to the central committee of the  
Reichsbank, ended with a description of what he still regarded as the most serious task in hand:

'The whole extraordinary depreciation of the mark has naturally created a rapidly increasing  
demand for additional currency, which the Reichsbank has not always been fully able to satisfy.  
A simplified production of notes of large denominations \[including printing on one side only\]  
enabled us to bring ever greater amounts into circulation. But these enormous sums are barely  
adequate to cover the vastly increased demand for the:means of payment, which has just recently  
attained an absolutely fantastic level, especially as a result of the extraordinary increases in  
wages and salaries.

'The running of the Reichsbank's note-printing organisation, which has become absolutely  
enormous' is making the most extreme demands on our personnel. The dispatching of cash sums  
must, for reasons of speed, be made by private transport. Numerous shipments leave Berlin every  
day for the provinces. The deliveries to several banks can be made ... only by aeroplanes.'

On September 1 the Reichsbank issued a note with a face value of 500 million marks; the new  
word 'billiard' was coined, joining three more noughts to the old milliard; and 50 million marks  
were needed to buy one pound sterling.

Circumstances rapidly grew more favourable to the forces of Fascist darkness operating in the  
south. Externally, perhaps, they were encouraged first by the success of the military party in  
Spain, but more by Mussolini's successful defiance of the League of Nations following his  
bombardment and occupation of Corfu at the end of August.\* (A measure taken precipitately in  
retaliation for the shooting by brigands on Greek soil of the Italian member of a commission  
delimiting the frontier between Greece and Albania.) Internally, the all-pervading economic,  
financial and political uncertainty which had effectively smothered the old national spirit, was  
now the food of extremism. The, most moderate persons declared that firmness — a strong hand  
— was required. They would have agreed with Stresemann that 'In dringenden Notfdlle muss  
geschossen werderi ('In pressing emergency there must be shooting'). To many, however, Berlin  
had become synonymous with weakness, the Republic with misery. Thus on September 2, 1923,  
a hundred thousand demonstrators gathered for the Nazi rally at Nuremburg, where Hitler stood  
at Ludendorff's side and launched yet another virulent attack upon the government which, he  
alleged, was about to surrender Germany's honour to France. After the parade, the Deutsche  
Kampfbund — the German Combat Union -was formed with Ludendorff as its president. Within  
the week, speaking sometimes five or six times a day, Hitler was calling for the installation of a  
national dictatorship. All he thought he required now was a final national catastrophe in the Ruhr  
to prove him right and to carry him to power.

Extremism was no less evident on the Left. Stresemann stated privately his belief that the  
Communists could not let the present opportunity pass without making a desperate effort to upset  
the existing order: they would never get such a chance again, 'and the German working class, at  
heart inclined against Communism, had had its vision clouded by the terrible stresses it had  
undergone.\* (Not for nothing was Stresemann heard quoting a new verse to the National  
Anthem, beginning: 'Deutschland, Deutschland, über alles, und im Ungluck nun erst recht, 'Erst  
im Ungluck Idsst's sich sagen ob die Liebe frei und echt ...' ('Deutschland, Deutschland, über  
alles, and more than ever in distress: to be first in misfortune lets one say whether charity is free

and true ...')) Hamburg, where bourgeois families were taking steps to protect themselves from  
outbreaks of revolutionary looting, simmered with discontent, the more so as 600 workmen who  
had been conspicuously active during the recent shipyard strikes had not been allowed to resume  
work and were now resorting to crime for a living: the unemployment dole of 700,000 marks a  
day (about 3.5d) made no serious contribution to the needs of a married man with two children.  
There were many there and elsewhere to heed the cry of 'Hands off proletarian Germany!' now  
emanating from Radek in Moscow and Zinoviev in Petrograd.

At Dresden in Saxony on September 9 there took place a rally of'Socialist and Communist so-  
called 'self-protecting organisations', in which 8,000 men exercised and manoeuvred for two  
hours under the command of a local demagogue, Stadtbaurat Sierks, an ex-warrant officer. The  
Police President, Herr Mehnke, who had once done two-and-a-half years' penal servitude, stood  
by applauding as Sierks proclaimed: 'We are here to protect the dictatorship of the Left ... If the  
workers do not join us in their masses, they must be brought out at the point of the bayonet ... It  
is better that I should do his than that the same task should be left to Hitler's hordes: I must  
anticipate his actions.'

It was notable, too, that the parade took place with the connivance of the Prime Minister, Dr  
Zeigner, who had countenanced the formation of the Red Centuries, dragons' teeth which were at  
last beginning to sprout. Wherever lay the political sympathy of Herr Mehnke's police, however,  
it did not prevent them from wounding 13 unemployed rioters in a fracas in Dresden two days  
afterwards.

The nation was also threatened with territorial disintegration, beyond that being engineered by  
France in the Rhineland. From Stettin came the warning of a plan to set up a dictatorship in  
Pomerania, East Prussia and Bavaria: it would have been a somewhat disjointed arrangement  
with Herr Noske, the former Defence Minister and now Provincial President of Hanover, as its  
leader, and Hitler as his Bavarian deputy; and since, though monarchist in flavour, it would have  
been Socialist in outlook, Ludendorff would not have been used. How developed was this plot is  
hard to say. Among the evidence was the concentration in large amounts of foodstuffs, especially  
potatoes, done with an eye, perhaps, to establishing confidence in the movement's efficiency; the  
result in Pomerania at least was a shortage of potatoes in spite of a good harvest.

Financially and constitutionally, in the meantime, new measures were being hurried forward, too  
little and too late, to cope with events of which nobody was in control. The new taxes and the  
gold loan had in no worthwhile way improved or even altered the situation (although gold loan  
'coupures' became negotiable instruments, credited by the public with constant value). More  
links were added to the long chain of legislation against traffic in foreign currency, each of  
which people in the main had no choice but to ignore, since marks were hardly exchangeable  
except over government counters.

On September 8 a Commissioner for the Control of Foreign Exchange was appointed, with the  
widest powers to seize foreign currency wherever he could find it, and to oblige holders of bills  
of exchange or of gold securities to deliver them against gold loan scrip. The appointment  
required the suspension of various portions of the constitution with regard particularly to postal  
secrecy, domestic inviolability and the expropriation of goods or property generally; and within  
ten days the new Devisenkommissar had assumed the right also to seize gold, silver, platinum

and alloys, whether in coin or raw metal. This move was in part occasioned by the realisation  
that as 200 million gold marks had been set aside to guarantee the Reich dollar Treasury bills,  
Germany's gold reserves were effectively down to the equivalent of less than £14 million, too  
little now with which to establish a new currency in which people could believe.

Thus under the commission's auspices the Wucherpolizei on September 20 raided the cafes and  
restaurants of Unter den Linden and the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin, forced every customer to  
produce his wallet or purse, and extracted all foreign money therein. The yield of the day's raids,  
for which receipts were duly given, consisted of 3,120 dollars, £36 sterling, 373 Dutch guilders,  
475 Swiss francs, 200 French francs, 42,523 Austrian kronen, 37 Danish kroner, 30 Swedish  
kronor, 1,402 Czech koruna, 800 Hungarian korona, 143 Serbian dinars, 18,000 Bulgarian lewa,  
30 Estonian marks, 5,100 Polish marks and 500 Soviet roubles.

The exercise went not only to shbw the futility of the new policy, but to underline the  
desperation of an advanced industrial nation which was unable to find accommodation in a  
foreign market to the extent of £6 million, the amount Germany then needed to borrow. 'It is,'  
Addison had written in a private letter to Miles Lampson,\* (Later 1st Lord Killearn. He had just  
returned to the Foreign Office from Siberia.) 'as though I was unable to borrow a farthing.'

Unknown heights have now been reached \[ran that letter, dated September 11, 1923\]. The  
floating debt increased this morning by 160,000 milliard paper marks. Efforts to calculate in  
something else are vain: it all comes back to paper marks. The shops are demanding pounds,  
francs, Danish crowns and any other foreign currency you may care to enumerate, and then take  
half an hour ascertaining how many thousand millions they require in paper marks: hence an  
increase in prices quite beyond the fall in the mark. Except for things like tram fares, we are now  
charged for most articles a few hundred millions more than the same would cost at present  
exchange rates in London. It is natural, for the shopkeeper discounts a further fall. He has  
become unaccustomed to thinking in simple figures, so it is thought 'that forty or sixty shillings  
must be nothing without millions at the end of them. The Adlon Hotel charges the equivalent of  
£4 or £5\* (Ten or twelve times the London price: a bottle of good claret at the Savoy Hotel in  
1923 cost about 10 shillings.) for a bottle of wine ...

Addison felt that Germany was 'marching with giant strides towards something very unpleasant'  
— yet people were still arguing about the responsibility of the industrialists for the nation's woes,  
or about the form which self-help should take. He had met Germans who appeared genuinely to  
believe that because conditions had been getting worse for four years they could go on getting  
worse for ever.

But obviously something goes on only until the moment when it cannot, and that comes  
suddenly. Nobody thought the war was near an end in March 1918. Nobody in France  
anticipated the French Revolution because the shop of Reveillon Freres was sacked by the Paris  
mob.

You should see the long queues of people standing for hours on end in front of the Berlin  
provision shops. The housewife cannot clean her home or look after her children if she has to  
stand from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. for a piece of sausage which in the end she does not get. The patience  
of the people is marvellous, but a German crowd when angry is ugly.

He had personally been to take a look at the situation first-hand in Bavaria where food was short  
in the towns but plentiful in the country. However, he was unable to buy an egg from a farm with  
paper marks, having been told by a peasant 'Wir wollen keine Judenfetzen von Berlin' ('We don't  
want any Jew-confetti from Berlin' — the popular description for Reichsbanknotes). Bavaria was  
pining for the good old Thaler, given up in 1870 — the coin from which the dollar itself derived  
its name.

Addison's letter had a post-script:

Since writing the above the pound has gone to 500 million, a drop of 200 million in less than 24  
hours.

The new danger was that when the peasants finally refused to deliver produce to the towns, the  
towns would go and fetch it. It had happened in Austria during the blockade. It had happened in  
the Ruhr and the Rhineland under the provocation of French militarism and enforced idleness.  
Now there were reports from Saxony -unoccupied Germany — that bands of several hundred  
townspeople at a time had taken to riding out into the countryside on bicycles to confiscate what  
they needed.

Anna Eisenmenger's diary included a first-hand account of the plunder of Linz and its  
neighbourhood in Austria — the place which Hitler regarded as his home town. She transcribed a  
letter from her daughter who had been staying there for a few weeks with cousins who ran a  
small farm with eight cows, two horses, twelve pigs and the usual poultry:

I had driven with Uncle and Aunt to church at Linz. The nearer we approached the more  
crowded became the usually deserted high road. All kinds of odd-looking individuals met us.  
One man wearing three hats, one set on top of the other, and at least two coats, excited our  
amusement ... We met people drawing carts piled high with tinned foods of every description ...  
A man and a woman were seated in a ditch by the side of the road and, without the least  
embarrassment, were changing their very ragged garments for quite new ones. 'Hurry up', the  
woman shouted to us, 'or there'll be nothing left!' We did not understand this remark until we  
passed the first plundered shops.

Peaceful Linz looked as if it had been visited by an earthquake. Furniture smashed beyond  
recognition littered the pavements. But not only provision shops, inns, cafes, and drapers' shops  
had been looted. Jewellers and watchmakers, too, had been unable to defend their wares. We saw  
that the inn at which Uncle and Aunt usually stopped after Mass was completely devastated. The  
old innkeeper caught sight of us and hurried up, almost in tears. He could not open his inn  
because all the furniture had been smashed and all the provisions stolen; and he strongly advised  
my uncle to drive home, since the ringleaders of the mob were inciting their followers to ransack  
the neighbourhood ...

My uncle urged on the horse ... In the lane which winds to my uncle's farm ... we noticed a  
troop of about 80 or 100 men and and women. They were bawling and singing and driving in  
their midst a cart harnessed with a brown horse. Uncle exclaimed: 'They're driving away Hansl  
and our cart!' Without another word he leapt to the ground, but could only advance slowly with  
his stiff leg across the field towards the road where he meant to intercept the troop ...

A lorry load of gendarmes turned up at that moment. A few shots were fired, and the mob  
dispersed into the hills, the horse and cart left behind.

In the cart I saw three slaughtered pigs. In addition, some pieces of slaughtered cows and pigs  
and a few dead hens were lying in an untidy heap. 'My God, my God', wailed my aunt. 'What  
will things be like at home?' ... Two gendarmes accompanied us in order to ascertain the  
damage. 'If only they didn't always destroy everything', said one of them. 'As for their being  
hungry, that's not surprising'. We were prepared for the worst. The gates of the farmyard were  
wide open. There was not a sign of the servant girls. A pig seriously injured but still living was  
lying in its own blood in the yard. The other pigs had run out into the road. The cow-shed was  
drenched in blood. One cow had been slaughtered where it stood and the meat torn from its  
bones. The monsters had slit up the udder of the finest milch cow, so that she had to be put out of  
her misery immediately. In the granary the store of grain and fodder were in a state of wild  
confusion ... a rag soaked with petrol was still smouldering to show what these beasts had  
intended. In the kitchen-living room of which my aunt was so proud not a thing had been left  
whole. Uncle estimates the damage at 100,000 peace kronen, and no insurance company will pay  
him any compensation for his loss.

The towns were starving. The countryside had had a bumper harvest, but there it remained  
because of the farmers' steadfast refusal to take paper for it at any price. Something had to be  
done to shift it. On September 18 were published the plans for the new Boden Credit Bank, later  
to be known as the Rentenbank, a bank of issue backed not by gold (it was too late for that) but  
by mortgages on both agricultural land and industry. It was fundamentally an expedient to induce  
the farmers to co-operate in feeding the nation: and the Bodenmark was by way of a solid form  
of Kontomark — the units of account worth ten cents each which the Reichsbank was now using  
to express the real values of current accounts: at last the old fiction of Mark gleich Mark had  
been formally abandoned.

The most usual comment on the new scheme was that, having found the printing press almost  
played out as an instrument of inflation, the Reichsbank was looking round for a new one. The  
Bodenmark was, after all, in no way intended as a means towards stabilisation. Like the gold  
loan which preceded it, and like the rye loan — to be issued and repaid according to the going  
price of rye — which was proposed simultaneously, it was merely a stop-gap: nor was it  
suggested that the printing presses should stop. Indeed, ten and twenty-milliard mark notes were  
just coming into circulation, the larger falling from a theoretical exchange value of perhaps £50  
on the day of issue (September 15) to £30 within seven days. By this time there was an acute  
divergency of up to 40 per cent between the official exchange rate and the free market rate. The  
paper mark was finding fewer and fewer takers and every-industry was fixing its prices  
according to different indices.

In the first half of September, the Ruhr was responsible for five-eighths of the daily increase in  
the floating debt -- 50 milliard marks a day spent to maintain the workers there in idleness,  
somewhat -but not much — more than the phenomenal costs of subsidising the German railways  
and postal services. To some extent, the Ruhr financial operation was actually supporting the  
franc, for marks, were being used there to buy up that much less sickly currency.

The Ruhrkampf had turned sour. No doubt the idea of it still roused patriotic fervour in many  
parts of Germany: certainly the suggestion that surrender might be the more practical solution  
was still worth more than any politician's life. In the Ruhr itself, though, demoralisation among  
the working class was deep, the result of acquiring the habit of idleness while on insufficient pay.  
In national terms, coal was the crux of the struggle: Germany could not carry on without it, and  
for that reason it had become certain that, whatever one chose the expression to mean, Poincare  
would 'win'. A Pyrrhic victory for France would be of no more than academic comfort to the  
losers: nor would Stresemann be allowed by the reactionary movements to exploit it.

By the end of the third week in September, therefore, the Government's control of the political,  
let alone the financial, situation was strained to breaking point. So were the ministers: according  
to Benes, then Czech Foreign Minister, they were so exhausted that they were incapable of any  
real consideration of the problems they had to deal with, 'the decision of which depends on  
which minister had most sleep the night before'. The proclamation of September 19 threatening a  
month in gaol and unlimited fines to anyone who hoarded food or money, or prevented the  
paying of taxes, or impeded the distribution of food or fodder, though signed by the Chancellor,  
the Minister of the Interior and the President himself, was a useless act of desperation: everyone,  
ministers included, was hoarding all he could; no one made any effort to pay taxes; and the only  
impediment to the distribution of food was the lack of a negotiable currency to pay for it.

There was, however, no doubt about Stresemann's determination. His problem was how to  
abandon passive resistance without the loss of Germany's dignity. It was a problem without a  
solution. Following an apparent agreement between Poincare and Baldwin that no point of policy  
divided Britain and France, and learning of the illegal declaration of a State of Emergency in  
Bavaria, Stresemann, who had been fully prepared to act on his own if the Reichstag should  
stand in his way, at last looked facts in the face.

On September 26 he suspended seven articles of the Weimar constitution, himself declared a  
State of Emergency, and gave executive powers to Herr Gessler, the Defence Minister who had  
succeeded Noske after the Kapp Putsch. This transfer was a formality. Effectively, from then on,  
for five months, General von Seeckt, Commander-in-Chief of the Reichswehr, was the supreme  
executive and administrative power in the land.

Germany had become a military dictatorship, no less, and by the choice, at that, of a largely  
Socialist cabinet. The country was divided into seven military districts, with a local military  
dictator over each. Simultaneously President Ebert announced the end of passive resistance in the  
Ruhr.

### 12: The Bottom of the Abyss

HERE, perhaps, was the strong hand that moderate Germans had wanted for months. They had it  
at a cost beyond the imagined loss of international dignity. There could now be restrictions on  
personal liberty, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of association. The  
army and the police might interfere at will with postal, telegraph and telephone services, indulge  
in house searches, and confiscate property. Incitement to disobedience could be punished with  
imprisonment or a fine of up to 15,000 gold marks. If lives were endangered the punishment  
would be penal servitude. Death would meet death — and would also be the penalty for the ring-  
leading of armed mobs, treason, arson or damage to the railways.

The Right, presumably, would have wished for no less. However, Berlin was only catching up  
with the game. Bavarian leaders had already questioned Benes about Czechoslovakia's attitude in  
the event of a declaration of independence. Benes told them (he reported to Curzon) that he  
would remain neutral provided there was no union of Bavaria with Austria, and 'provided the  
movement was left in the hands of Hitler and Rupprecht \[the Wittelsbach crown prince of  
Bavaria\] and that Ludendorff had nothing to do with it.'

Munich's rulers knew Hitler rather better than Bene- did. The Bavarian emergency had been  
proclaimed mainly in response to Hitler's putting 15,000 SA troopers on the alert and assuming  
leadership of the Kampfbund — no one knows whether or not he intended a coup d'etat at that  
moment. Now the Bavarian cabinet, equally unconstitutionally and in violation of the Treaty of  
Versailles, appointed the anti-Republican politican Gustav von Kahr as State Commissioner-  
General with dictatorial power over the state. Von Kahr thereupon sat on a furious Hitler, and the  
situation was soon regularised, in name if not in practice, by Gessler's appointing von Lossow,  
the local Reichswehr commander, as the official government commissioner with von Kahr as his  
civil arm. Because from then on communication between Berlin and Munich became  
progressively more sticky, the new reality was that Germany had two dictators, one in either city.  
Von Seeckt rapidly reduced an ill-organised Right-wing Putsch at Küstrin in Prussia to  
impotence, taking the opportunity finally to suppress the 'Black Reichswehr', (the remnants of  
the Free Corps), and would treat equally firmly the Left-wing movement in Saxony. Much  
though Helfferich, the leader of the Nationalists, might fume in the Reichstag against Germany's  
new capitulation to France, the fact remained that a way out of the diplomatic and economic  
impasse was at last opening up.

It is a matter for record that at this desperate point in Germany's fortunes at least some sectors of  
the economy were trying to maintain business as usual. A case in point was the motor industry  
who decided to go ahead with their October motor car exhibition in Berlin, designed to show that  
the German manufacturers were still a world competing force. Critical opinion held that this was  
not proved. The main difference since the last motor show in 1921 was the huge increase of  
small cars and cycle-cars, the majority ugly and of doubtful quality. The well-known makes had  
developed very little.

Euler still shows his fantastic car shaped like a drop of water \[the Tropfenauto\], blunt end at the  
front \[reported the British Commercial Attache sourly\], Maybach again his gearless chassis,  
Benz and Mercedes their usual types, and the only other make worth mentioning is the Audi,

which has possibly improved. All the bodywork is inferior, the colour schemes are painful, and  
the shapes are monstrous where not stereotyped. The fittings are shoddy and in bad taste. There  
is no intelligible basis for prices.

A strong hand at the centre, or centres, brought none of Germany's tangible problems nearer  
solution. Indeed, in almost every way things were rapidly worsening, with accelerating inflation  
at the root of every trouble. In the last week of September the Reichs-bank issued 3,267 million  
million marks, a sum with a current exchange value of £5.2 million a day. Duly responding, the  
mark, at 315 million to the pound on September 11, reached 1,500 million to the pound on  
October 2, and 5,700 million on October 9. The Reichsbank stepped up its output.

These extraordinary figures betokened terrible distress. The average pre-war wage had been  
about 36 gold marks — £1 16s — a week. In October 1923 the purchasing power of the average  
wage fell to less than 20 per cent of normal. The situation hardly required extremists to whip up  
revolutionary feeling. Sums of less than one million marks were no longer dealt with, and,  
indeed, as Lord D'Abernon reported to Curzon, 'a beggar would hardly accept any smaller note.'

And yet the distress was not only physical. For eight months the German people had been  
assured by their Government, and taught to demand, that passive resistance would never be given  
up. To the ignorant this implied that it could go on for ever. Every window and every kiosk was  
still placarded with exhortations to stand firm, or with appeals for funds, or with pictures of  
French troops beating the population. Now all this suddenly ceased, and the people were calmly  
informed that their Government had been making fools of themselves and that they must  
surrender unconditionally over a matter which had cost them trillions of paper marks and an  
immeasurable amount of inconvenience and suffering. Contempt for the Republic and its  
servants now became almost universal.

'The population is ripe,' Joseph Addison wrote home to Alexander Cadogan,\* (Later Sir  
Alexander Cadogan, O.M., Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1938-1946.)  
'to accept any system of firmness or for any man who appears to know what he wants and issues  
commands in a loud, bold voice.'

Addison had another significant point to make:

Economic distress is leading the people to be much more amenable to authority as representing  
the only hope of salvation from the present state of affairs. Unemployment is taking the gilt off  
the gingerbread of democracy, while the working classes realise that striking is useless since  
nothing would be more welcome to employers.

At the beginning of October, just after the passing of the new Currency Bank Law, Stresemann  
tried to push through an Enabling Act, taking further extra-constitutional powers for the  
government. His Volkspartei had seen the opportunity to give a death-blow at last to the eight-  
hour day, a piece of revolutionary legislation which business interests still condemned with  
peculiar hatred: and the new proposal was the very negation of Social Democracy. The issue split  
the Ministry, and now even Hilferding, who had clung to his post of Finance Minister like a  
limpet, felt obliged to resign with his Socialist colleagues. The government fell.

Stresemann's new Ministry which took office on October 6 was inevitably further to the Right,  
seeking a formula for making people work harder and German industry more productive. It was a  
programme with which the working people were disposed to agree. They had little enthusiasm  
left for democracy, and were themselves moving towards authoritarianism through sheer  
weariness of spirit and an almost complete indifference to anything except their own lack of  
material comforts. The Chancellor was to get his Enabling Act on October 13. The Volkspartei's  
manifesto of October 4 therefore only reflected national predilections when it asserted that 'the  
helm of the Ship of State must be put over to the Right ... Marxism has ruined Germany ... An  
end must be made to this policy of compromise. Away with the Socialists out of the  
government!'

Away they went, though not without a counterblast from the unions: 'Obey only the instructions  
of your organisation! Maintain discipline! Down with the enemies of the working class! Long  
live the Republic!'

The workers, however, accepted that the Ruhr struggle was over. On September 30 the  
Kolnischer Zeitung (price 5 million marks) had published a copy of the declaration that workmen  
had to sign on returning to work for the French regie — an oath of service to the Belgians and  
the French. On October 6 the German government abandoned the 'Rhein-Ruhr-Hilfe' — aid to  
the area — but prepared to carry on paying the dole to those who could not find work: until  
November 1 the dole was to be twice the amount payable elsewhere, after which it would be the  
same, which was to say equal to half the estimated basic requirement of whoever received it..  
The pressure was already on: and on October 7 a number of industrialists including Herr Stinnes  
and the director of the Prussian State Mines, (but not Herr Krupp von Bohlen, who was still in  
gaol) approached the French Commander-in-Chief with a view to resuming work. Discussions  
continued, and a week later the German government instructed the railway personnel to return to  
their posts.

It remained as true as it had even been that no settlement of any kind was possible until German  
finance had been restored. The resumption of coal deliveries to France and any other deliveries  
in kind could only be paid for by the government. The only means of paying was increasing the  
issue of banknotes. On October .10 the pound stood officially at 7 milliard marks — but on the  
free market one could get 18 milliard for it. On October 15 the official rate was 18.5 milliard and  
the free market rate into the 40 milliards. Every kind of plan for currency reform was in the air,  
based on gold, or rye, or foreign exchange or 'material values'. The. great question was whether  
foreign control of Germany's finances would be acceptable. The formula of a small loan, a new  
bank of issue, and supervision by an external agent would probably have worked in Germany  
even better than it had done in Austria: the great advantage for any country whose currency had  
gone to pieces was that one could start with a clean sheet, public and municipal debts wiped out.  
The talk went on as the mark shot downwards meaninglessly from worthless to very worthless,  
as poverty, hunger and now cold gripped the nation. The working classes were at last undergoing  
what the middle classes had been suffering for three years.

When the Rentenmark Ordinance was published on October 15, creating the Rentenbank, it was  
hailed as radically unsound. The Rentenmark was the Bodenmark rechristened, in essence a  
modified Roggenmark (or rye-mark), the device propounded by Karl Helfferich; and it was  
designed to win support from Helfferich's agrarian Nationalists as well as from the Left who

found the Roggenmark politically suspect. Whatever might be said against the Rentenmark —  
especially about the reality of its backing — it met the fundamental principle of releasing the  
Reichsbank from the fatal obligation of having to finance the government. If it worked, it would  
carry Dr Havenstein back to the currency framework of 1913, when every banknote meant what  
it said. The Rentenmark was the contrivance of Hilferding's successor at the Finance Ministry,  
Dr Luther, and of Dr Schacht, the managing director of the Darmstadt & National Bank who was  
soon to be appointed the new Currency Commissioner. However, in the middle of October, the  
Rentenmark scheme was just one more of the currency plans which, as Addison had it, 'simply  
smudge one's brain with ink'. There was no new bank of issue, still less any new banknotes  
which might replace the old.

Although Munich and the municipalities of Bavaria were suffering no more than the same  
economic rigours as anywhere else, it was evident that here was the most explosive mixture in  
Germany. The new British Consul-General at Munich, Mr. Robert Clive, noting that numerous  
press correspondents had gathered in the Bavarian capital, ventured that so far as he could gather  
'nothing for the present is likely to happen'. New decrees were issued daily prohibiting public  
meetings and strikes, and there was no doubt that the two authoritarian friends, von Kahr and  
General von Lossow, were in full control. So confident were they, indeed, that they were  
calculatingly ignoring instructions received from Berlin. Their posture even went to the lengths  
of refusing Berlin's order to ban Hitler's newspaper, the Volkischer Beobachter, on October 2,  
but none the less suspending it for ten days from October 5 for publishing a treasonable article.

'Bavaria prefers Kahr,' wrote Clive. 'The eclipse of Hitler is almost complete.' Von Kahr, in fact,  
was tearing leaves wholesale out of Hitler's book, deliberately fostering the war responsibility lie  
(the Kriegschuldlüge) and expelling dozens of Jewish families, from paupers to profiteers, from  
the state: when the Munchner Post accused him of taking this action expressly to please Hitler, it,  
too, was suppressed.\* ("The Post probably was unfair to Kahr, who was something of a pietist,  
unreasonable to deal with, and considered himself the Providential instrument chosen to deliver  
Germany from Socialists as well as Jews.) Von Lossow was no more amenable to central  
discipline than Kahr. Kahr did not answer letters. It was reported by Addison, to whom  
Stresemann had poured out his woes:

Lossow is always protesting that he is doing his best to carry out instructions as Reichsdiktator,  
but somehow something invariably happens to nullify those excellent intentions: his instructions  
arrive too late, or he is out at lunch, or he is burying his aunt ... For practical purposes Bavaria is  
no longer part of the Reich.

On October 20 Kahr overruled Berlin's dismissal of Lossow.

The central government's difficulties can hardly have affected the populace on the spot, least of  
all those whose minds were not permanently fixed on political or military adventure. 'The  
distress is very great,' said Clive's report of October 18.

Few families can afford meat more than once a week, eggs are unprocurable, milk terribly scarce  
and bread already sixteen times the price of a few days ago when the maximum price was  
abolished. It is no doubt true that the expensive restaurants are full of well-dressed people  
drinking wine and eating of the best in Munich — but they are either German-Americans

mistaken for locals, or Ruhr industrialists ... No one expects political disturbances, but hunger  
riots are another matter ... and the cold: no one can afford central heating. No one imagines the  
Renten-mark will help.

So, too, Herr von Haniel, Berlin's representative Reichsminister in Munich:

The desperate economic conditions are mainly responsible for these recurring troubles. Things  
could not be worse. Demoralisation and irresponsibility are rampant, and will continue until  
some light appears on the horizon and the feeling again begins to grow that there is something to  
live for, beyond the value of the dollar and the necessity to get rid of paper marks before they are  
worthless ...

Elsewhere the people were equally resorting to direct action where the government was failing  
them. Troops with machine-guns patrolled the streets of Bremen whose cotton-spinners and  
shipyard workers were all on another cost-of-living strike. There, and in the surrounding  
province of Hanover, unemployment'was increasing by about 10 per cent every week, and prices  
were rushing upwards in terms of gold as well as of paper. Mr Elphick, the Consul at Bremen,  
had just arrived there:

The first thing that strikes one is that the days of German cheapness seem to be practically over.  
One comes to this country full of stories of the wonderful value to be obtained for one's money  
in all directions. On arrival one finds that prices in Germany have not only reached the world  
level but are already outstripping it, so that it is actually cheaper to buy in England than locally.  
The reason is that even in Germany it is now fully realised that the mark is absolutely valueless  
and all prices have been placed on a gold basis.

Generally speaking a 'ground price' is fixed on gold marks at double the pre-war figure, and this  
is multiplied by a multiplica-tor fixed by the retailers themselves, according to their own free  
will, and which increases not only day by day but frequently even hour by hour in an effort to  
keep pace with the Gadarene downward rush of the paper mark — rather, to keep ahead as, in  
order to provide against the rapid depreciation on their hands of the resultant 'gold' price in paper  
marks, an enormous rate of profit is included.\* (The envelope of Elphick's letter to London,  
postmarked October 22, bore stamps with a face value of 148,000,000 marks.)

On October 24 the Bremen Senate took it upon itself to issue gold notes to a total value of 1  
million dollars, not in marks but in denominations of a quarter, a half and one dollar, with  
smaller values of five and ten cents expressly to be used for daily purchases without the necessity  
of exchanging them for paper marks. Gold certificates had already been issued as part of wage  
packets, and were repayable in five months time either in Bremen State 5 per cent dollar bonds  
or in Reichsbank currency at the middle official New York rate. The one-dollar note, on the other  
hand, was redeemable at any time in paper marks at the full official rate without the usual tax on  
foreign exchange transactions. As the issue was backed by all the receipts and resources of the  
fich state of Bremen — an important gateway to Germany in the event of the nation's breakup —  
it seemed to be as stable a currency as it was then possible to devise in any part of Germany.

Bremen took the calculated risk that the continued issue of paper marks would put into operation  
Gresham's Law, that bad money drives out good; and so that the new gold notes would merely be

hoarded. However, by the autumn of 1923, a new factor was at work — the absence of any  
ability to hoard. Workers and petits bourgeois alike had been reduced to penury, their realisable  
resources gone. Stocks of retail goods badly needed replenishing so that small trade might  
revive; but pockets were empty. It seemed improbable that anyone would continue to handle a  
currency which nobody wanted, so that, contrary to theory, the better medium would actually  
drive the inferior out of circulation. One result hoped for from the gold issue was a fall in prices  
as retailers no longer had to allow for depreciation.\* (On February 10 1923, Professor J. Shield  
Nicholson pointed out in The Scotsman: 'After a point in the depreciation of paper money the  
reverse of what is called Gresham's Law comes into play: the legal tender in spite of penalties  
loses its purchasing power. The better money drives out the worse ... The feeble efforts of the  
German Government to restrain speculation in paper marks are as useless as the chains and death  
penalties decreed to support the Assignats \[of the French Revolution which were made legal  
tender in 1790 but abandoned in 1796 as unworkable\].')

Separatism of the financial variety was the least of the government's worries. Territorial  
separation threatened in Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and the Rhineland. There was even a Guelph  
secessionist plot in Hanover, with its figurehead the Duke of Cumberland — the English title of  
the grandson of the deposed Elector of Hanover. The most menacing, after Bavaria, was the  
Rhineland separatist movement which had been gaining strength for many weeks — at least, it  
had been increasing noticeably in the numbers of its marchers and rioters and in the volume of  
their cries. At Düsseldorf on September 30, twenty thousand separatists had gathered, marched  
and killed eleven policemen — the crowds imported by train with French permission and  
encouragement while the local population locked its doors and stayed at home.

Further outbreaks with and without French support occurred throughout the following three  
weeks, and at last, on October 21, a Rhenish Republic was proclaimed in the Belgian zone, at  
Aachen. It was immediately quashed with a sharp note to Belgium from Curzon. However,  
supported by French troops, separatist administrations were instantly declared at Bonn, Trier,  
Wiesbaden and Mainz in the French zone. The leaders of the new Republic quarrelled, the  
German civil service refused to co-operate, and the regime and public services collapsed. The  
French then turned their attention to the Palatinate, an integral part of Bavaria, intimating that it  
had become an autonomous State.\* (\*The story of how Curzon knocked this one on the head is  
retailed in Curzon: The Last Phase, Harold Nicolson, Chapter XII.)

Simultaneously with the Rhineland diversions came serious and dangerous Communist-  
encouraged trouble in Hamburg. Fundamentally the cause was the old one: when the week's  
wages were received in the tail of another currency collapse they were entirely inadequate for  
people's needs. On October 15 the authorities withdrew the bread cards which had enabled  
people in need to buy bread at less than half the market price. A week later the dockers and ship-  
builders went on strike again. Police stations were rushed, trees felled across the streets, trenches  
dug, and the few open food shops which the rioters could find plundered. One coup had already  
been suppressed in Küstrin; and the government were taking no more chances. The German  
cruiser Hamburg arrived accompanied by torpedo boats and put ashore enough marines to stamp  
the rebellion out and arrest 800 of its Left-wing activists.

On October 15, the mark's rate against the pound passed 18 milliards. On October 21, after the  
mark had moved in three days from the 24 milliards to 80 milliards to the pound, Lord

D'Abernon noted with some statistical glee that (at 60 milliards) this was 'approximately equal to  
one mark for every second which has elapsed since the birth of Christ'. At the end of the month  
the banknote circulation amounted to 2,496,822,909,038,000,000 marks, and still everybody  
called for more. On October 26, the Reichsbank in Berlin (where there had been no bread for  
some days as bakers were short of flour) was surrounded by a crowd demanding milliard-mark  
notes which were carried off in baskets and carts as soon as they were printed. The first billiard,  
and 5-billiard, and 10-billiard notes would be ready on November 1.

Thus the Hamburg disturbances at the end of October, although worked on by the Left, were the  
product of the most genuine frustration and despair. Depreciation had taken place so rapidly that  
wages could no longer be readily adjusted by the use of index numbers and multiplicators.  
Workmen who had been receiving 405 million marks a day on October 1 (about 6s 8d at the then  
rate of exchange) and 6,500 million on October so, suddenly found that their new packet (with  
the exchange at 50 milliards) represented only is 7.5d. Prices, on the other hand, had pretty well  
kept pace with the exchange rates: in the main, the speed with which retail prices moved was a  
protective measure. Business had become virtually impossible, and shopkeepers who kept going  
were subject to a new ordinance — promulgated on October 22 — compelling them to keep their  
shops open and to offer goods in exchange for paper marks.

As elsewhere, the cry remained in Hamburg for wages of fixed value. It appeared to be a long  
time since the unions' single demand had been for ever-higher wages — enough marks to meet  
the Increase in prices. On October 26 the very men who were clamouring for fixed wages turned  
down the offer of a wage rendered in the new Hamburg gold mark notes on the dual grounds that  
their employers were in no position to pay it and that, in any case, they needed paper marks to  
meet their living expenses. People hardly knew what they wanted. On November 1, after the  
Hamburg assembly had voted 500,000 milliard marks (nearly.£2,000) to relieve distress,  
Hamburg, went back to work again, with payment in the port being made after all in the  
municipal 'gold' currency.

The arrangement was far from perfect, because the notes had to be converted into paper marks  
before they were spent, and outrageous advantage was frequently taken by the moneychangers.  
However, general relief that the' Communist uprising had been suppressed was so great that the  
seriousness of the industrial situation in the city was widely unappreciated: Hamburg's 100,000  
unemployed included 30,000 shipbuilders, 6,000 longshoremen, and some 60,000 others.

It was the same story all over Germany, better in some places, worse in others, and worst in the  
Ruhr. Dismissals continued everywhere. A contingent of marines from the Hamburg was  
despatched to the Ruhr because of the trouble feared following the decision by Thyssen, Stinnes  
and other industrialists to close down many of their factories. Their discussions with the French  
had been amicable, to mutual advantage, but in conflict with the requirements of Berlin.

The Chancellor visited the Ruhr and returned, appalled, on October 27. The run-down of the  
official dole in the occupied areas was all but complete, but even at its risible national level the  
government could no longer afford to continue subvention of any kind. The trade unions were  
reporting an over-all German unemployment figure of 18.7 per cent of their members, with  
another 40 per cent of the work force on short time which varied from 4 or 5 to go or 40 hours a  
week. Apart from the 2 million workers in the occupied territories, the government was paying

unemployment relief to 877,262 in unoccupied Germany (where union unemployment was at 10  
per cent) and short-time relief to nearly 1,700,000 others. There were as many more whom no  
relief was reaching. Practically all the stagnation in unoccupied Germany was due to the shutting  
down of the rest.

For November, Stresemann said to D'Abernon, there was the prospect of 5 million workers  
without work, without government support, and largely without food. More riots were inevitable.  
Stinnes and his colleague Vogler were to continue negotiations with the French, but it seemed  
certain that the Nationalists, with Stinnes behind them, were determined as their first priority to  
destroy the present government. That was only half of it. The coal tax demanded by the French  
as part of the price of a return to normality simply could not be paid. The Rhineland had become  
the domain of lawlessness, anarchy and the unrestrained terrorism of armed separatist bands,  
occupying the town halls and, with French support, defying the police. In the country in general,  
the population would no longer accept a currency in any form which lost half its value every  
successive day. Nor was this all.

Dr Zeigner's Communist ministers in Saxony had issued a manifesto setting up a red  
dictatorship, and Zeigner had declined Berlin's ultimatum bidding him restore order.  
Furthermore, knowing that his only hope, and perhaps Germany's only hope of surviving as a  
complete nation, was the introduction of a stable medium of exchange, the Chancellor now  
expressed his doubts that the Rentenmark would be effective even as a stop-gap. Most surely, the  
pips had squeaked.

On October 30, with the mark at 310 milliards to the pound, the Berlin government faced five  
immediate crises: Bavaria, Saxony, the Rhineland, the question of resumption of work in the  
Ruhr, and the financial chaos.\* (The taxation system remained largely based on paper values  
until December I923. In October a passport at the Polish border still cost 2 paper marks, the tariff  
never having been raised since the war.) On a successful outcome to the Ruhr negotiations  
depended further negotiations with New York for the supply of sufficient credits to buy essential  
imports of food and fuel. If the loan were large enough, it might be possible, in conjunction with  
Germany's remaining reserves, to start a new currency. Otherwise the government had nowhere  
to look for the oxygen that might keep it going a little longer.

Its troubles, however, were not coming in single dozens. On November 1, Hitler's Bavarian  
levies were understood to be mustering on the border of Thuringia (with much moral support  
from Brandenburg and Pomerania), threatening to deal with the Communist insurgents there if  
the Republic would not. The military Commissioner-General in Saxony, meanwhile, to whom  
reinforcements had been sent, proceeded with such force (as well as success) against the Red  
Centuries and their sponsors — Zeigner and his ministers were arrested -- that it provoked an  
adverse reaction from the Socialists in the Reichstag and contributed to the brewing Cabinet  
crisis. On November 2 there was violent panic on the Berlin Bourse — not because of Bavaria or  
the Cabinet crisis, nor merely because of the mark which had just lost four-fifths of its value in  
three days, but rather because of the realisation that there were no fewer than eight official kinds  
of paper in circulation, outside the numberless issues of emergency money made by  
municipalities, industrial firms and the federal states. The official tokens ranged from the  
Reichsbank notes and railway Not geld to gold loan 'coupures' and Reich dollars. It was a period  
(said Lord D'Abernon) of 'chaos the like of which had not been seen in economic history.'

On November 5, the military authorities considering that the action against Saxony was  
complete, the Reichswehr turned upon Thuringia, drawing more protests from Socialist deputies  
many of whose constituents were now in the line of fire. On November 6, the looting of  
foodshops — with strong anti-Semitic overtones — started in the poorer quarters of Berlin,  
where the population was once again in the acutest distress because of the farmers' reluctance to  
sell their produce in the cities. A British businessman, Mr J. C. Vaughan, passed through Berlin  
and wrote a letter of protest to the Foreign Office in London:

I was sickened by the sights I saw. I happened to pass through the Arcade between the  
Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden, and in that small space I saw three almost moribund  
women. They were either in the last stages of decline or starvation, and I have no doubt it was  
the latter. They were beyond asking for alms, and when I gave them a bunch of worthless  
German notes, it shocked me to see the eager way in which they seized upon them — like a  
ravenous dog at a bone. I am no pro-German, but that we should tolerate such a state of things  
five years after the Armistice is to my mind appalling. I cannot help doubting whether persons  
who have not seen these miserable things really realise what they are ... Of course one sees  
motors and crowds of well-to-do people in profusion in Berlin, but do we know what is going on  
in the poorer quarters? The waiting queues tell their own tale ...

This was the common lot in the industrial areas and in the towns everywhere, except in the  
municipalities whose Notgeld based on gold values had proved acceptable and whose basic  
needs could be supplied by their immediate agricultural neighbourhoods. Such havens were few.  
In Breslau, another foreign businessman who had lived since September largely on bread and  
weak tea found that he could get 'one square meal a day by crowding into a restaurant in the  
early morning and waiting until luncheon was served some hours later'. Although he had money  
to pay for what he ate, he went hungry to bed each night.

The fact was that although the farmers' barns all over the country were bursting with unsold  
food, Germany was suffering from widespread famine. Every Zurich provision shop had a  
placard saying: 'Send food parcels to your friends in Germany.' As ever, and worse than ever, the  
conditions and prospects of the middle and professional classes were fearsome. Only two  
remedies seemed possible, the one preposterous, the other elusive to the point of absence: food  
from abroad, or a stable medium which would persuade Germany's farmers to release food in  
exchange for paper.

The Thuringian action held the lid down for two more days on the boiling Bavarian kettle.  
Hitler's hopes that a pitched battle with the Communists of Thuringia or Saxony would lead to  
Bavarian troops marching on Berlin were dashed. Tension in Munich mounted hourly as Kahr  
and Lossow toyed — or so it was believed — with proclaiming Bavaria's secession as an  
independent monarchy. This danger, with the necessity to do something positive in order to ride  
with the revolutionary momentum which had been building up ever since the end of the  
Ruhrkampf, persuaded Hitler to attempt his Putsch on the night of November 8.

The course of the Bürgerbraukeller Putsch and its ignominious end the following day after one  
volley from the Munich police guarding the Odeonplatz is not strictly part of this story, and has  
anyhow been related often enough.\* (The accounts in Wheeler-Bennett's The Nemesis of Power  
or in Bullock's Hitler: A Study in Tyranny seem to need no embellishment.) The important

considerations are that Hitler and the Nazi Party were able shamelessly and facilely to use the  
miseries inherent in a severe inflationary situation to drum up nation-wide opposition to  
authority and to persuade many thousands of people that the fault and the blame lay directly in  
many places where it palpably did not: with the men who had signed the Armistice, with the  
French, with the Jews, with the Bolshevists. Inflation played into Hitler's hands, and was no  
more the invention of the Communists, who were also taking advantage of the social wreckage it  
was causing, than of Hitler and the Nazis.

Inflation is the ally of political extremism, the antithesis of order. At other times — in post-  
revolutionary Russia, in Kadar's Hungary — it may have been deliberately engendered in order  
to destroy the social order, for chaos is the very stuff of revolution. In Germany at this time,  
however, the inflationary policy was the consequence of financial ignorance, of industrial greed  
and, to some extent, of political cowardice. It therefore produced hothouse conditions for the  
greater and faster growth of reactionary or revolutionary crusades. Hitler set his hopes in 1923 on  
'the revolt of starving billionaires'.\* (Konrad Heiden, in Der Führer: Hitler's Rise to Power,  
explains fully how Hitler played on the economic fears of all classes at this time.) He gave the  
Bavarian authorities and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the Berlin authorities a very nasty turn  
during that second week of November. To the Reich government for twenty-four hours, as  
sympathy for Hitler mounted in East Prussia and Pomerania, there appeared to be a real danger  
of civil war not confined to Bavaria. And yet the Communist rising that had just been suppressed  
in Hamburg a few days before was regarded — at least until Hitler's trial in February 1924 — as  
the much more sinister and dangerous episode. In fact the danger of a workers' revolution other  
than under Communist sponsorship was what had hurried the Communist Party, in due  
consultation with Moscow, into promoting its ill-co-ordinated national insurrection.

The bloodletting in Bavaria — where martial law was declared -hardly served to cool passions or  
relieve the unhappiness anywhere else. Von Seeckt set about suppressing all the extreme parties,  
armed with the powers of the latest presidential decrees. In the interest of calm, the President and  
the Chancellor issued a proclamation condemning the treasonable outbreak in the south and  
pointing out that the latest currency measures had improved the mark manifold within 34 hours;  
but this sumptuary triumph was short-lived. The first 100-billiard note\*\* (The highest  
denomination ever printed: 100,000,000,000,000 marks, referred to in Germany (as in Britain) as  
one hundred billion.) was already out. Dr Havenstein's presses were giving of their bounty to the  
record tune of nearly 74 million million million marks a week, quadrupling in six days the  
previous total circulation. The cost-of-living index, taking 1914 as 1, had risen from September's  
average of 15 million to 3,657 million in October and now, on November 12, was at 218,000  
million.

The women of Cologne, where there were nearly 100,000 work-less, sent an emotional but  
hardly exaggerated appeal addressed 'To the Women of the British Empire':

During the times of passive resistance we existed, not by industry, but through the paper money  
doles sent from unoccupied country. Now these have ceased and we face starvation. Industry  
cannot recover, and there are millions, literally, out of work ... tens of thousands of our leading  
citizens have been banished or imprisoned ... our newspapers have been suppressed ... armed  
hordes of adventurers have now been let loose on our disarmed and helpless population in the  
name of separatism and Republicanism ... Winter is before us, and we have no coal ...

In fact the German government was preparing to leave the finances of the occupied zone to their  
own fate. It was something that might have been done rather than embarking on the suicidal path  
of passive resistance, but of course the previous January humanitarian and patriotic  
considerations had made it impossible. The danger now was that the end of financial aid would  
throw the area into the arms of the separatists: a proposal to set up a new bank of issue for the  
Ruhr and the Rhineland was viewed with great dismay for that reason, unless it could be  
absorbed into the new Rentenbank when it came. Negotiations between the French and the  
industrialists continued unavailing. However, it was certain that the Rentenmark would go the  
way of the paper mark if unproductive payments in subsidies and doles to the Ruhr were to be  
prolonged. To avoid that, even the payment of old age pensions was to be abandoned —  
although for the present, still, paper sums to the amount of millions of gold marks were being  
despatched daily to occupied Germany to save the population.

'The industrial firms and the muncipalities in the occupied areas did their best to cushion the  
effects of the coming change. The district of Solingen, for example, made an issue of gold-based  
marks with cover provided by the foreign exchange balances standing to the credit of members  
of the Solingen Chamber of Commerce. Hochst dye works made their second issue of gold-mark  
currency covered by the deposit of more than 400,000 Swiss francs in a Zurich bank. Several  
firms made large purchases of milk and potatoes to sell to their own workers, but could only  
afford to pay them 70 gold pfennigs, about 8.5d or 20 cents, an hour. The margin between skilled  
and unskilled labour had been reduced to about 10 per cent throughout Germany. Labour was  
more demoralised than ever, and the output per working man less than pre-war.

### 13: Schacht

WHEN Dr Schacht was appointed Commissioner for National Currency on November 13, the  
questions were still being asked, in what form of stable currency was the paper mark to be  
redeemed, and at what rate of exchange. They were academic questions, because no one nursed  
more than a hope that the Rentenbank scheme could work. Every day was seeing some new  
order issued to direct the still mounting financial, economic and administrative chaos, the net  
result having been to confound the confusion further. The absence of newspapers because of a  
printers' strike from November 10 to 16 considerably augmented consternation, rumour and  
panic, as people were in general ignorant of the latest prices, the news from Bavaria, or even the  
desires of the administration.

Schacht was faced with incredible disorder. During the previous ten days expenditure had  
exceeded revenue by 1,000 times. The floating debt had been increased fifteen times. The  
government would shortly be unable to pay cash wages to the Army, to the police, or to its own  
officials. Already the officers of the Ministry of Finance itself were being paid partly in potatoes.  
The budgetary estimates included on every page the outrageous reminder, in brackets, that all  
figures were in quadrillions.\* (US notation, with 15 noughts. Government expenditure at this  
time amounted to 6 quintillions (US notation, with 18 noughts) to which revenue had contributed  
a mere 6 quadrillions, one-thousandth as much.) The Rentenbank Directorate tended  
unashamedly to the Right, comprised of large landowners, big industrialists, agricultural interests  
and the like -the class of people whom the inflationist policy had enriched and who had escaped  
paying their just dues to the State — so that there was not much hope of a democratic outcome.

What followed Dr Schacht's appointment and the fledging of the Rentenbank on November 15,  
exactly a month after the original Ordinance, was astonishing. On that day, when the discounting  
of Treasury bills was at last halted by the Reichsbank, Dr Havenstein had unparalleled resources  
coming to the rescue of the mark which only the previous day had fallen to 6,000 milliards to the  
pound. According to Dr Schacht the unissued paper marks then in the hands of the Reichsbank  
and its branches would have filled 300 ten-ton railway wagons.

The engine of inflation had been put out of gear, but still the country's finances hurtled downhill  
under their own stupendous momentum. In the course of the next five'days, as the first Ren ten-  
marks appeared, the mark in Berlin fell, and was allowed to fall, to 12,000 milliards on  
November 15 to 18,000 milliards to the pound on November 20, the equivalent (for sterling had  
recently been depreciating in New York) of 4,200 milliards to the dollar. The face value of the  
total circulating notes doubled again in those five days, and the paper mark became worth  
exactly one-million-millionth of the gold mark. It was at that point, when it was only necessary  
to strike off 12 noughts to effect a simple conversion, that the paper mark — still the only legal  
tender — was at last stabilised.\* (Had the mark been stabilised at its rate on November 15, the  
unworkable and difficult coefficient of 1.66 recurring would have been needed for all  
conversions.) A million million marks equalled a gold mark. A gold mark equalled a  
Rentenmark. Mark gleich Mark, once more: the vital question was whether anyone, whether  
everyone, would believe it. Confidence was all. Dr Luther, the Finance Minister, compared the  
exercise to building a house beginning with the roof.

There were problems, many of which had already been thrashed out at the end of the summer.  
The gold and gold-equivalent reserves had been so frittered away during the Ruhrkampf that they  
were inadequate to back the new currency. The Rentenbank's notes were therefore guaranteed in  
equal amounts by mortgages on landed property and by bonds on German industry — trade,  
commerce, banking and transport — to a combined amount of 3,200 million gold marks, about  
£160 million. The maximum note issue in Rentenmarks was to be 2,400 million. The  
Rentenbank was independent (as the Reichsbank had been) of government interference. In return  
for special credits of 1,200 million to the Reich — including 300 million Rentenmarks at nil per  
cent to pay off the floating debt — the government guaranteed not to discount any more Treasury  
bills with the Reichsbank. During the five days following November 15, when the paper mark  
was allowed to lose another half of its value although discounting had stopped, the gold-mark  
equivalent of the discounted Treasury bills fell from 320 million to 191.6 million. By the device  
of waiting for a round number, the Rentenbank had done the Reich a most advantageous turn.

The pause, in fact, struck another blow at the insensible, many-times-overkilled national creditor,  
from the War Loan lender to the mortgage granter, from the life insurance policy owner to the  
cooperative society member, from the savings bank depositor to the debenture holder, all of  
whose chances of justice now finally crumbled to dust. For them the extinction of the National  
Debt was the extinction of hope. Germany's debtors, public and private, had been relieved of  
their obligations to a value estimated at £10,000 million.\* (Philip Snowden, Chancellor of the  
Exchequer, in 1930 estimated that the war had cost Great Britain an identical sum — on much of  
which interest is still being paid, War Loan of more than £2,000 million never having been  
redeemed although its terms have altered.)

Even at the time outsiders were astonished that the German middle classes, as well as the more  
organised bodies such as savings banks or trade unions, acquiesced unmoved in a remedy,  
however efficacious,'which consecrated their spoliation by extinguishing all debts and  
annihilating the savings of the great majority. The seal of permanence had been put on the  
people's losses; as Bresciani-Turroni described it, 'the vastest expropriation of some classes of  
society that has ever been effected in time of peace.' These classes, wrote Addison from Berlin in  
1924, 'accepted both approaching and accomplished ruin with no less stoicism than the first  
painful symptoms of convalescence — heavy taxation and widespread unemployment.'

Perhaps they did so because their despair was complete; but more likely because most of them  
simply did not understand what was happening. The Rentenmark was, in its literal sense, a  
confidence trick. The real value of the mortgage guarantee was exceedingly doubtful, if not  
entirely illusory. Moreover, although the discounting of Treasury bills ceased, the discounting of  
trade bills had to continue, and did so apace. The 'miracle of the Rentenmark' was that from  
November 20 onwards the price of the paper mark remained steady while the number in  
circulation did not stop growing. Depreciation stopped, in other words, but the inflation of the  
money supply went on.

It was what had happened in Austria. The real value of the Reichsbank's circulating medium in  
November 1923 was still at less than a thirtieth of what had been found necessary in the stable  
years before the war. There was a desperate physical shortage of cash, of which the Rentenbank,  
if it were stretched to its legal limits, would only have been able to make good about a third.  
There were hundreds of authorised and illegal issues of Notgeld to be replaced, and an immense

amount of foreign exchange to work out of the system: the sum of the former has been estimated  
(with no certainty) at 1,000 million gold marks and of the latter at 2,000 million — together  
adding perhaps £150 million to the official issue.

By November 30, 1923, 500 million Rentenmarks had gone into circulation; 1,000 million by  
January 1, 1924; and 1,800 million by the following July. These issues were in addition to the  
paper marks still being added to the 93 quintillion,\* (The British and German 'trillion', or  
1,000,000. Confusion internationally about what anyone meant when speaking of the value of the  
mark led the British Embassy and others to adopt the American (and French) style for the larger  
amounts. This muddled people more than ever.) now equivalent to 93 million gold marks,  
circulating on November 15. The paper mark circulation rose to 400 quintillion on November 30,  
to 690 quintillion at the end of March 1924, and to 1,211 quintillion in July; a sum not far short  
of £70 million, or two-thirds of the value of the Rentenmark circulation. It was well to  
remember, admonished Costantino Bresciani-Turroni, the economist member of the Reparations  
Commission writing in 1931, that

the stabilisation of the German exchange was not obtained by means of contraction, or even by a  
stoppage of the expansion of the circulation of legal money. On the contrary, the quantity of the  
legal currency rose considerably.

It was an essential prerequisite of recovery: but to have announced that the Government would  
be issuing within eight months more than twelve times the total amount of paper marks  
circulating at the moment when the Rentenmark was introduced would have had a psychological  
effect nowhere short of disastrous.

The Rentenmark's own position was anomalous. It was not legal tender but, rather, 'a legal means  
of payment'. It was not convertible into gold, still less into the agricultural or industrial assets  
which were supposed to back it, although 500 Rentenmarks could be converted into a bond with  
a nominal value of 500 gold marks. The legal tender was still the mark, dead but mummified,  
and negotiable because its constancy at a million-millionth of its nominal value was guaranteed  
in people's minds by the Rentenmark, itself only another piece of paper with a promise on it. The  
legal reduction of the paper mark to this extreme fraction was not sanctioned until the monetary  
law of August 30, 1924, which permitted the conversion of the note inscribed 'Eine Billion Mark'  
(with the addition, in the interests of clarity, of the further inscription '1,000 Milliarden') into a  
Reichsmark.

The immediate basis of stabilisation, therefore, was not the closing down of the printing presses  
so much as the rigorous disciplining of State expenditure by the refusal of further credit to the  
government and by a return from a floating mark to a fixed parity against gold and the dollar.

As it was, the confidence trick worked. The Rentenmark, the stopgap designed to shift the 1923  
harvest, became the weapon which held the field for the billion-mark note until the Reichsmark  
was brought in a year later. 'On the basis', said Bresciani-Turroni, 'of the simple fact that the new  
paper money had a different name from the old, the public thought it was something different  
from the paper mark ... The new money was accepted, despite the fact that it was an  
unconvertible paper currency. It was held and not spent as rapidly ...

The same experience had already been found, not only in Austria, but with the spurious gold loan  
issue of August in Germany: it had had no genuine cover but, because the gold loan bonds had  
been labelled 'stable-value', it was enough to make the public not only accept but hoard them.  
The velocity of the circulation slowed from a mad gallop to a sedate walk. In the case of the  
Rentenmark, the fact that it was to win the confidence of agriculture was the most important  
advance of all. From the day of stabilisation onwards, there was at last the prospect that food  
might flow again back into the cities, and that one day the nation's budget might again be  
balanceable.

Dr Schacht had two immediate problems in establishing the new medium. One was the black  
market — on which the dollar was fetching in the last week of November up to 12,000 milliard  
marks, nearly three times the new official rate. The other was the Notgeld, the emergency money  
which was largely on an equal footing with the paper marks and which was the severest threat to  
continued stability. 'Everyone his own Reichsbank' was a system which Schacht determined to  
end. The announcement that the Reichsbank would no longer accept new issues of Notgeld  
aroused a storm of protest from those who, at the Bank's expense, had grown used to, and fat on,  
the practice of printing their own currency.

At a boisterous Cologne meeting on November 25, the National Currency Commissioner resisted  
the supplications and threats of a large assembly of industrialists and municipal officials — all  
aimed at restoring the acceptance of Notgeld — and declared that the decision stood, and that  
they would once more have to accustom themselves to budgeting with stable figures. The day of  
reckoning had dawned. With every cause for misgivings, Germany now peered fearfully forward  
into the December murk.

The black market was dealt with automatically, but no less brusquely. Speculators closing their  
books at the end of November, when the black-market dollar rate was at its highest, had not the  
money to meet their commitments. Credits which the Reichsbank would formerly have gladly  
given were no longer to be had, so that anyone who had bought dollars at 12,000 milliard marks  
each was now forced to sell them back at 4,200 milliard, losing two-thirds of their outlay. Before  
December 1, £10 million in foreign currency had returned to the Bank in this way. The  
speculators took off for Paris and went to work on the franc, their departure the first signal that  
stabilisation was a fact.

Dr Schacht sat in a single room which had once been used as a charwoman's cupboard, looking  
on to a backyard in the Ministry of Finance. From this post he transformed the German financial  
system from chaos to stability in less than a week. His secretary, Friiulein Steffeck, was later  
asked to describe his work as commissioner:

What did he do? He sat on his chair and smoked in his little dark room which still smelled of old  
floor cloths. Did he read letters? No, he read no letters. Did he write letters? No, he wrote no  
letters. He telephoned a great deal — he telephoned in every direction and to every German or  
foreign place that had anything to do with money and foreign exchange as well as with the  
Reichsbank and the Finance Minister. And he smoked. We did not eat much during that time.  
We usually went home late, often by the last suburban train, travelling third class. Apart from  
that he did nothing.

The arcane, abstruse financial manipulations in the Finance Ministry passed largely unnoticed by  
most of the population, whose preoccupations on November 15 were hunger, cold, and the  
steadily mounting social unrest and misery. Rioting and highway robberies were occurring all  
round Berlin. The passage of Stresemann's Enabling Act had made it possible to give greater  
powers of action to von Seeckt, who now instructed the military authorities to aid the civil ones  
in controlling food prices; but even so it had been thought wise to send home the female staff of  
the Reparations Commission.

Three days after the official stabilisation, no more food than before had appeared in the markets.  
The high price of beef and mutton, which were plentiful, made eating it out of the question. No  
pork was being delivered, because, said the reports, the farmers were eating it themselves. Owing  
to the absence of artificial oils from abroad there was a shortage of cattle feed, and milk yields  
were falling off. Berlin's daily milk consumption of 1.8 million litres had fallen to 130,000, and  
the city's biggest dairy, Bollo, was selling only 25,000 litres a day against more than a million  
before the war. Butter was not obtainable, and would anyway have been too expensive for most  
people.

More than financial collapse, the Socialist politicians were worried by the collapse of Germany's  
new democracy. Ever since the suppression of the Left in Thuringia, the Reichstag had been  
bubbling with indignation against the Chancellor. The Socialist vote brought his Ministry down  
on November 23 on a motion of no confidence and on the ground that he would not end the State  
of Emergency; yet there were other reasons for their disgruntlement. Stresemann had come to  
office in August in order to stop inflation and, by implication, to depose Dr Havenstein.  
Havenstein, by an odd quirk of fate, had actually died on November so, the very day of  
stabilisation, and only resigned his effective management of the Bank by doing so. The  
appointment by Stresemann of Hilferding as Finance Minister had done nothing to stem the tide  
— and as Stresemann stepped down there was little real sign that Hilferding's successor, Dr  
Luther, was achieving any more. Stresemann, it was also recalled, even by his supporters, had  
taken office in the wave of optimism following the British Note of August 11, declaring that  
passive resistance in the Ruhr would not cease:\* (The dramatic introduction of half-starved poor  
into the precincts of the Reichstag in August also led to Cuno's fall.) but he had personally  
stopped it, and still no settlement had been reached with the French. The Ruhr was the final  
sticking point: the possibility that the workers there would be abandoned to their fate after so  
many months decided the vote, even at the risk of exchanging one administration for another  
further to the Right.

No confidence in Stresemann, dead tired as he was, did not imply any confidence in anyone else.  
Lord D'Abernon described von Seeckt's operations as moderate and tactful, dictatorial as they  
were: but in the last week of November he also found the confusion in the political world  
'indescribable', the Ruhr problem more acute than ever, and the financial difficulties no better.  
Apart from the fact that the Communists in Hamburg and Dresden, where they had been  
exceptionally strong, now seemed to be completely cowed (von Seeckt's latest decree had  
abolished the extreme parties of Left and Right, to the reconciliation of moderate opinion), he  
could see no light on the horizon.

Yet sanity was slowly returning. Stresemann's fall and the political problems it posed obscured  
the more promising developments, but did not endanger them. An agreement of a sort was

suddenly cobbled together between the Ruhr mine-owners and MICUM, the Franco-Belgian  
Commission of Control which had replaced the German Coal Syndicate when the Ruhr basin  
was occupied, to the effect that the mine-owners would make full deliveries of reparation coal  
and coke and would pay $15 million in arrears of coal tax. Thus, at obvious cost to the prospects  
of economic recovery in Germany, were Poincare's 'productive pledges' secured; and the way  
opened (although it was not followed: Poincare had to fall first) for a French evacuation.

Nor was external agreement all. The decision to put postal charges on a gold basis, the  
announcement of the dismissal within two months of 10 per cent of the railway personnel,  
together with other drastic economies, the agreement of the miners to work (for the time being)  
an eight-hour, rather than a seven-and-a-half hour day underground, and of State officials and  
employees and even of the iron and steel industry to go back to a nine-hour one, the reduction of  
official salaries to below pre-war levels — these were all substantial straws in the new cold  
winds of realism that were starting to howl across the country.

Such moves were reinforced, first, by the collapse of the provisional government of the Rhenish  
Republic and, second by the assumption of the Chancellorship by Dr Marx of the Centre Party,  
who formed a Cabinet on November 30, with Stresemann as Minister of Foreign Affairs. When  
on December 8 the Reichstag adjourned until the middle of January, it marked the end of the  
Cabinet and parliamentary crisis which had begun when passive resistance was abandoned in  
September.

The overriding issue was the swelling unemployment. The extent to which the act of stabilisation  
contributed to the number of workless is not easily determinable. Already Germany's finances  
and economy had deteriorated too far for any measure to have slowed or even arrested the rapid  
upward trend: and the time when palliatives might again have postponed the evil day of mass  
idleness had certainly passed. The old currency having been reduced to total unacceptability,  
there was no way whereby printing money could keep anyone in his job any more. The choice  
had simply become between unemployment and financial chaos or unemployment and monetary  
discipline. Either alternative meant misery, but the second at least held the promise of food, and  
a way out of the cul de sac. It was not that Germany's unemployed noticed the distinction at first.  
The week of the interregnum between Strese-mann's and Marx's administrations produced a  
recurrence — largely Communist inspired again — of the endemic disorders in D-iisseldorf,  
Essen and Gelsenkirchen, with armed fights against the police and much bloodshed. Food was  
the problem.

The first signal that stabilisation was a fact may have been the exodus of the international  
parasites to Paris, lured by the depression of the franc; but the subsequent signs 'were far less  
welcome. Taxation now began to weigh heavily. Interest rates remained high, at 100 per cent.  
Shortage of capital and credit meant high prices and closing factories. The cost of living crept up  
and up, now in real terms. Certain real costs rose very suddenly, such as university tuition fees,  
which caused student enrolment to fall. State and municipal relief was even less adequate than it  
had been. The trade unions, whose funds had vanished with the paper mark, were in turmoil.

During the earlier phases of inflation, workers' wages were low but on the whole enough. As  
exchange movement became violent, working-class hardships became greater. The sudden shock  
of stabilisation brought almost intolerable strain. By Christmas the registered unemployed total

in unoccupied Germany, mounting all the time, was more than 1.5 million — twice the figure of  
early November; but the real total was probably a million more, and the number on short-time or  
on reduced pay embraced the majority of the work force. Arthur Rosenberg, from the far Left,  
estimated that only 30 out of every 100 workers were in regular employment. Workers soon had  
to accept employment on any terms of wages or hours — a condition of which hard-pressed  
employers took full advantage, backed by the government's benevolent, weary neutrality.

The government, indeed, having put the screws on the nation and made Schacht President of the  
Reichsbank for life, could do little but hope the cure would work, prepare its new tax ordinances,  
and make such directions to ease people's difficulties as cost nothing. Trial by jury, for example,  
was temporarily abolished because of the financial hardship to jurymen. A greater act of faith, as  
well as of necessity, was the decision that only half of the salaries of officials would be paid on  
the week ending December 17, and that the balance would be made up when taxes furnished the  
revenue. But here there was reason for confidence. Taxes had been quickly put on a gold basis.  
Whereas immediately before stabilisation the budgetary deficit between receipts and expenditure  
had been 99 per cent, in the period after November 20 it dropped to 92 per cent, and in the last  
ten days of December to 44 per cent. December's revenue was 33 million gold marks; but the  
following January's was to be 440 million, or 95 per cent of outgoings. After a lapse in February  
1924, the budget finally balanced in March.

Although its success in restoring order to German finances was to be far greater than had ever  
been hoped, the Rentenbank's most important immediate triumph was in achieving that first  
object of a universally acceptable currency: shifting the harvest. The 1922 medical reports had  
shown that every great town in Germany had substantial pockets of desperate undernourishment.  
Throughout the urban nation, lack of food, clothing and warmth had produced all their  
concomitant ailments, from ulcers to rickets, from pneumonia to tuberculosis, all pitifully  
aggravated by the soaring costs of medicines and medical supplies. Another year of infinitely  
greater deprivation had taken a more terrible toll, and now there was the certainty of the  
demoralisation of prolonged unemployment to come.

Food, however, was beginning to appear again in the towns half way through December; and to  
the Rentenmark alone was this development due. In 1923, before November, the only increase in  
animals slaughtered for food had occurred in dogs:\* (Mainly used to supply a deficiency in  
pork.) after stabilisation, the consumption of every article of daily need — beer, pork, coffee,  
sugar, tobacco — increased regularly, except dogmeat. On Christmas Day 1923, Lord  
D'Abernon wrote of the 'magical wand of Currency Stability':

Not even the most fanatical advocate of stabilisation — and this title I yield to no one — could  
have anticipated more remarkable results from its attainment than those which are now manifest.  
Food has become abundant in the great towns; potatoes and cereals are brought to market in  
large quantities; while butter, which was obtainable only in the better quarters, is now offered at  
stable, if at high prices. Animals crowd the abattoirs and queues have disappeared from before  
the shops of butchers and provision merchants. The economic detente has brought in its train  
political pacification — dictatorship and Putsches are no longer discussed, and even the extreme  
parties have ceased, for the moment, from troubling ...

The euphoria of the immediate post-stabilisation months communicated itself to Bresciani-  
Turroni, writing six years later of the beneficial influence of the reform:

Commerce revived, the food situation in the cities was eased, the purchasing power of many  
classes was increased, the factories reopened, unemployment declined rapidly, and a refreshing  
wave of confidence revived the energies of the people.

It was all true — for a space. In February 1924 Dr Kuczynski, a leading German statistical  
authority confirmed that a sea-change had come over German life: 'The difference in public  
feeling compared with two months ago', he told the British Ambassador, 'is absolutely  
astounding. Then everyone was depressed and thought a catastrophe imminent. Today they are  
full of confidence. There is no adequate physical or economic reason for this — the change is  
mainly psychological. You may say it is based upon the Renten-mark, but that is more or less a  
fraud, and it would be more correct to say that it is due to the moral effect of the mere cessation  
of printing banknotes, or more correctly to the belief by the public that printing has at last  
stopped. This has given them so much confidence that they keep the circulating medium in their  
pockets and tills — £125 million there today against £5 million last September ...'

Sanity had returned to Germany's finances; and no doubt 1924, a period of often extreme  
monetary stringency, consolidated the financial recovery. But it was too much to hope after the  
Dawes Plan was adopted in August and unemployment dwindled encouragingly throughout the  
summer and autumn, that years of reckless profligacy could be so easily paid for, or what the  
country had passed through would have no lasting effects on the people's minds. The destitution  
of the middle classes, of whom the resilient would recover in due course, was only part of the  
price. The economic reckoning was still to come. Some would say that the political reckoning  
did not come until 1933, when economic recovery had to begin again.

### 14: Unemployment breaks out

DR SCHACHT, the author of the reform, had no illusions about its shortcomings. He understood  
that the Rentenmark could hold the tide only so long, that new credits from abroad were  
essential, and that for that reason no departure could be made (despite the pleadings of the  
government, desperate for money) from the strictest discipline. Nothing could be done that  
would put at risk the currency stability or the budgetary balance. 'After a long devaluation,'  
Schacht held on January 24, 1924, 'stability can only be regained at the cost of a severe crisis.  
We are in the midst of this crisis. External commerce is at a standstill. The balance of trade is  
active \[i.e. in Germany's favour\] only because imports have ceased as importers have no means  
of paying. Industry is living on old stocks.'

He had already seen Lord Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, about funding his  
Golddiskontbank, a project which successfully headed off the establishment of a new Rhineland  
bank of issue supported by the French; and at the end of January he went off to Paris where the  
Dawes Committee (under Dawes, the American financier) was starting its hearings on help for  
Germany and the future of the reparations question. His icy meeting with M. Poincare showed  
him that France was still insisting on her pound of flesh, and no less anxious than before to  
promote separatism in the Rhineland.

The confidence that had returned to Germany hardly affected the industrialists in these western  
provinces. Hard-pressed for funds from home and abroad, they now began to turn to the French  
for terms, considering (as Stresemann put it) that a patriot's first duty was to make money, not to  
become bankrupt. It had been their guiding thought for many years past, and Stinnes was more  
dangerously ready than most to agree to whatever Paris proposed. It concerned him little that a  
French-backed Rhenish bank in opposition to the Reichsbank would give a further boost to  
separatism.

Nor had the new confidence, or even the new plenty, worked itself through to the poor or the  
workless, least of all in the Rhine-Ruhr area. Stabilisation was having devastating effects on  
many sections of the food trade, especially the food importers. When the mark was still falling,  
the merchants had been able to charge high prices with the justification that they had to cover  
themselves against the fall. As the money received was in practice often converted into stable  
values, an unhealthy kind of business had developed. Not only did these merchants (along with  
most farmers) find it hard to return to a world of dull, small profits: many were being caught out  
by the availability of cheaper imported food, which left them with large, expensive, often  
perishable stocks on their hands. The biggest importers, who had ordered when depreciation was  
in full spate hoping to repay in depreciated marks at the Reichs-bank's expense, found  
themselves threatened with bankruptcy, panicked, and began to throw their stocks on to the  
market.

Thus from Cologne in the third week of January 1924 came reports of 'abundant supplies' of  
vegetables and fruit, domestic and foreign: German potatoes, eggs and butter; Italian cauliflower,  
Canary tomatoes, Spanish grapes, American apples, French nuts. A fortnight later, abundance  
had become a glut. People were being begged to buy milk at 36 pfennigs a litre (less than gd a  
pint). There were mountains of Hawaiian pineapple, Colombian salmon, and American corned

beef — all the product of bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy. Cheap as the prices were — beer was  
coming down 25 per cent at a time — the goods remained unsold, because the mass of the  
population were simply unable to buy. There was in fact much suffering, in part because a great  
many workers were on strike over the return of the ten-hour day, but more because so many of  
the larger factories had closed down. In the Ruhr and the Rhineland, unemployed were to be seen  
in crowds in every town.

There, food was cheaper but few were earning or receiving enough to be able to buy it. In the  
rest of Germany, although vegetables were still at a premium, the prices were coming down for  
more orthodox reasons. At Christmas 1 billion marks (a million million, the equivalent of a  
Rentenmark) would have bought two or three oranges, but in February the same sum would have  
bought 20 or 30 from the unemployed who, to the annoyance of shopkeepers, were hawking  
them in the streets. Margarine could be had for 500 milliards a kilo, having been as high as 800  
milliards. Frozen meat had ccme down from 600 to 450 milliards a pound, although fine cuts still  
cost 4 billions (45) a pound.

From an economist's point of view, a new era had dawned; but as the British Embassy reported  
home:

The poor are not really getting a proper amount of food, as they haven't enough money to profit  
from the cheaper market -- owing also to strikes and unrest, the stagnation of industry, and  
cessation of exports. There has been a general increase in the cost of living for such things as  
heat, light, and housing — all more than in Britain.

People needed work. The unemployment allowance was not enough; and the wages of part-time  
workers were too low even for necessities.

Bavaria quickly settled down politically once Hitler's 24-day trial, which started on February 2,  
1924, was over. The trial itself, having given a national and international platform to the  
protagonist, ended in minimum sentences for all the accused — to the affront of many, including  
Ludendorff whose own acquittal disgusted him, or so he maintained. At the end of the year,  
looking back at the events he had witnessed, the British Consul-General in Munich, Mr Clive,  
noted that

National Socialism had thrived in the existing depression of 1923. There was a don't-care feeling  
in the air. The greater fiasco of the trial disillusioned the minds of more reasonable people,  
although Hitler's party a little later got one-fifth of the Landtag votes ... Hitler's greatest enemy  
is the Rentenmark. It is impossible to overestimate the beneficial effect of the stabilisation of the  
currency on the Bavarian, and I suppose also on the whole German outlook. When the London  
Conference \[on the implementation of the Dawes Plan\] assembled in July 1924, six months of  
stabilisation had already had a calming effect on the Nationalist hotheads...

Von Kahr and von Lossow resigned in mid-February, permitting the re-establishment of  
agreement between Bavaria and the Reich.

In Bavaria, too, of course, the middle classes had gone to the wall. That was the story throughout  
urban Germany, although whether they felt harder hit, as well as hungrier and colder, at the end  
of 1923 than at the end of 1922 is hard to say: Christmas 1919 had brought destitution to so

many. People who lived on savings, or pensions, or war-disability grants, or assurance payments,  
or otherwise on fixed incomes, had to continue to make do on the proceeds of what chattels they  
could sell or what small, unaccustomed work they could find. Municipal soup kitchens often had  
to feed them.

Their numbers amounted to millions, and none was on the list of receivers of unemployed or  
short-time relief. They were the ones who had had their wealth shot away by the war, without  
knowing it. They looked in vain for charity to help, but the charitable institutions and the  
religious societies, just like the literary and scientific foundations and many of the universities  
and hospitals, had equally had the fountains of their incomes reduced to a trickle or less. Any  
who had held industrial debentures had lost their capital, to the benefit of industries who  
redeemed those debts with worthless paper. Any who had held industrial shares in 1913 would  
have had their capital reduced by three-quarters, and a pittance paid in dividend totals over the  
years -- but in practice most people had panicked long since and sold the bulk of their shares for  
what they could get for them to the industrial profiteers and speculators who amassed the nation's  
wealth to themselves, paying themselves not dividends, but 'fees'. Germany's capital had been  
redistributed in the most cruel way, no longer spread reasonably evenly among millions, but  
largely in coagulated blobs among the new plutocracy.

It was widely remarked that the destitution inflicted by the inflationary process was not general.  
The very evidence, indeed, of great wealth — ostentatiously flaunted by the new rich who had it

-   misled many observers, including the French, into supposing that Germany's refusal to pay  
    reparations on the nail was Teutonic knavery. The existence until the Ruhr invasion of full  
    employment, an obviously prosperous working class, a buoyant economy, a booming home  
    market, a strongly competitive position in foreign markets, factories bursting with production —  
    all made possible by the vast scale of Germany's borrowing — could have fooled anybody.

But inflation shed its deadly rain discriminately, so that for some the reality of pauperisation lay  
hardly below the surface. The rentier classes — the people whose livelihoods depended on their  
savings, or on annuities or pensions — have already been mentioned. They included the poorly  
paid professions — judges, army officers, parliamentary deputies and the like — whose positions  
and dignity had traditionally been supplemented by private means. There were other groups,  
mainly the professional people, whose services turned out to be expendable in what their clients  
would have seen as the short-term. Civil litigation, for example, became a luxury. Who would  
buy books? Who was in a hurry for architectural advice? Art and tuition could wait. There was  
no rush for any but emergency medical treatment, and even that could not always be paid for as  
soon or in such amounts as doctors would have wished: private patients were slow to come  
forward, and health-insurance companies could not pay the full fees because of what inflation  
had dpne to their funds. No one could tell how many dependants of these professional people  
went short on account of such a recession in business.

The common assessment that it was the middle classes who were left destitute is only part of the  
story. Certainly they had savings to lose, and they lost them, whether in paper form, or in the  
form of the jewellery, silver, furniture, pictures or other precious possessions with which they  
were obliged to part. Certainly the landlords were reduced, if they had no other source of  
livelihood, to beggary through the restriction of rents to nominal sums or through having to sell

off their property at knock-down prices simply to stay alive. Some householders survived by  
renting off apartments at realistic rates.

But not only the middle classes were going through the mill. Whereas the organised, unionised  
workers had managed by and large to keep their wage-packets at acceptable (although scarcely  
opulent) levels at least until the Ruhr struggle began to stifle the whole national economy, the  
unorganised workers had gone down with the middle classes. They ranged from tailors and cab-  
drivers to chimney-sweeps and domestic servants: painters, gardeners, chauffeurs, carpenters,  
shop assistants, printers, laundrywomen, cabinet-makers, porters; skilled and unskilled, male and  
female, from the self-employed to the sackable. A third group, which probably comprised a  
proportion of the foregoing, were the people who received small subsidies and pensions from the  
central or local governments — whose age and disability entitled them to an income from the  
public purse. But the social insurance contributions of years amounted in the end to no assurance  
whatsoever: the public purse in 1923 was paying them at rates which ranged upwards from the  
insulting to the disgraceful: and their numbers, excluding the unemployed, were reckoned at the  
end of the year at more than 5,600,000.

Stabilisation brought as little relief for the middle classes dependent on fixed incomes as for the  
working classes who could find no employment. A year of stability in Austria, it was observed,  
had gone far to prove the proposition that inflation had imposed a deeper, more devastating  
social change than anything the revolution achieved. The closing entries in Frau Eisenmenger's  
diary give some idea of what she had undergone:

Foodstuffs which three years ago were entirely unobtainable in Vienna and the rest of Austria  
\[she wrote in December 1923\], can now be bought everywhere. But who can buy them? Whose  
income has kept pace with the tireless activities of the banknote printing-press? Although my  
holding in shares is worth at today's quotation more than 10 million kronen, I am at my wits end  
to know where to find money to buy food ... today the value of our krone is quoted in Zurich as  
0.00705 centimes ...

On January 2, 1924 the full implications of the Austrian currency reforms dawned upon her:

The kronen and heller have been changed into schillings and groschen.\* (Their issue in silver  
and copper coins rather than paper was to encourage thrift and restore confidence. The change of  
style was to get rid of large figures.) It is a drastic change. For 15,000 kronen we get — one  
schilling! Thousands of Austrians have been reduced during the last days to beggary. All who  
were not clever enough to hoard the forbidden stable currencies or gold have, without exception,  
suffered losses. An old married couple with whom I have been friendly for years had a holding  
of government stock amounting to 2 million pre-war kronen which brought them in interest  
80,000 pre-war kronen a year \[more than £3,200\]. They were rich people. Today their stock  
brings them in 8 new schillings a year. Panic has seized the Stock Exchange. My millions have  
dwindled to about a thousand new schillings. We belong to the new poor. The middle class has  
been reduced to the proletariate. More fighting — daily, repeated, exasperated, demoralising,  
offensive and defensive fighting of man against man. I feel that my strength is deserting me. I  
cannot go on ...

Times were scarcely better in Hungary, for whom the year 1923 had been dismal. It began with a  
severe outbreak of anti-Semitism in January and with Count Bethlen's government coming more  
and more under the influence of the Right-wing nationalists whose numbers swelled as rumours  
of impending foreign interference gained ground: the 'Move' and the 'Awakening Hungarians',  
which were run by M. Gombos, Minister for War, had students and ex-officers as their main  
elements. The country's finances went from bad to worse, the government in many ways sharing,  
for want of any notion of how to put things right, the view propounded by M. Bruno Balogh,  
director of the British-Hungarian Bank, that

The only proper policy is that pursued by Germany where private undertakings are supported and  
developed without regard to the State finances. This is Germany's strongest point and France's  
greatest sorrow.'

The korona fell from 14,500 in March 1923 to 92,000 in August and to 120,000 to the pound in  
October, the free rates always being much higher and prices going at last to twice the level in the  
United Kingdom. Farmers had long ceased to hoard currency and now hoarded corn and cattle,  
to the desperation of the townspeople. A year after Dr Seipel's successful tour of Europe to find  
help for Austria, Count Bethlen, the Prime Minister of Hungary, set out, cap in hand, himself to  
ask for international charity.

In October 1923 the Reparations Commission did for Hungary what it had done the year before  
for Austria in waiving its first lien on the national assets; and in December more Protocols were  
drawn up in Geneva to arrange an international loan to restore the country's finances. Mr  
Jeremiah Smith, the American financier, went to Budapest as the League's Commissioner-  
General, and carried out his work on the lines that Dr Zimmermann had pioneered in Vienna. No  
less than in Austria did the population, especially the public servants, suffer the deprivations and  
ignominies of financial reconstruction. To these miseries were added during the pre-slump years  
both great land hunger among the peasantry and the lack of the strict democratic rights, including  
freedom of the press, which, for what they were worth, existed next door in Austria. The  
currency reform of 1925 permitted 12,500 korona to be changed for one new pengo.

In Germany a few of the victims of inflation actually obtained a minimal restitution. By 1922 the  
unfairness with which wealth and incomes were being redistributed had become extremely  
noticeable, the more so as the rights of creditors were being so outrageously usurped by the  
absurdly wide distinction between nominal and market values: the real value of a mortgaged  
property, for example, was no comfort to a creditor who had to accept paper rather than gold  
while the property itself remained securely in the debtor's hands.

As the clamour grew, with support from the Courts,\* (Most notably by a judgment given by the  
Supreme Tribunal at Leipzig on November 23, 1923.) against the iniquities which inflation had  
caused, the government attempted to redress what grievances it could. By the decree of February  
14, 1924, known as the Third Taxation Ordinance (one of more than 70 ordinances issued during  
the period of the Enabling Act), industrial debentures and mortgages were revalued at 15 per cent  
of their original gold price. Mortgage bonds, savings bank deposits and other obligations were  
revalued at slightly higher rates. Meagre as these terms may have been, they meant nothing to  
people who had been obliged to part with their securities or whose credits had been paid off in  
paper earlier on. A further law of July 1925 therefore introduced a retrospective element to cover

extinct mortgages and debentures which had been held in good faith since at least five years  
before, and raised the rate of mortgage revaluation to 25 per cent.

The 1924 decree also imposed a modest tax on the grosser profits which inflation had made  
possible, for example through the depreciation of industrial debentures — it amounted to less  
than 2 per cent of their original gold value; and an even smaller one in respect of rural profits -  
1.7 per cent of the original amount in gold of the mortgages whose shrinkage had so hugely  
contributed to them. These taxes were earmarked either for the Reich or for its constituent states.  
A move to revalue the government's own loans became law in 1925, which resulted in the  
stockholders' receiving 2.5 per cent of their original investment subject to reparations having all  
been paid (!), with an annual lottery for long-term holders who with luck would have their loans  
redeemed at 12.5 per cent without waiting for the reparations settlement. The public outcry that  
led to such slender satisfaction of creditors' demands was accompanied by violent speculative  
trading in government stocks and bonds on the Bourse, a practice already proceeding unhealthily  
in respect of the plunging French franc.\* (For a fuller account of the restitution programme and  
the behaviour and revaluation of stocks and shares, see Bresciani-Turroni. Caps. VII & VIII.)

Economic recovery, and a fall of interest rates from January's 100 per cent to May's 30 per cent,  
reduced the number of unemployed to half by April 1924. The great increase in imports during  
this period, however, led to such dangerous signs of weakness in the Rentenmark that Schacht  
intervened at once with drastic credit restrictions. The Reichsbanksprasident's unpopularity was  
enormous stability was immediately restored, but not without a return to higher interest rates,  
more bankruptcies, and more unemployment. Marks became practically unobtainable. At that  
juncture the Dawes Committee presented its plan, which was adopted by the Allies in August,  
for reparations to be paid only to the extent that Germany's currency could stand the strain. The  
new payments schedule, still without any specification of what the total settlement would be, was  
to be helped off the ground with a large foreign loan and the evacuation, at last, of the French  
and Belgians from the Ruhr. The Dawes plan also provided for the introduction of the  
Reichsmark to replace the old currencies.

There was once more an immediate return of confidence, the success of the Dawes loan being  
followed by other foreign loans, all of which helped to revive trade, to send shares up and the  
unemployment figures back down. By December 1924, the figure for the registered unemployed  
— about half the real number — was as low as 436,000. Until the arrival of Hitler in power in  
Berlin, there would never be so few out of work again.

Once more, however, here was a false dawn. Germany's trouble was that the inflation boom had  
never been liquidated. Stabilisation had ended the period when entrepreneurs could borrow as  
much as they wished at the expense of everyone else. A vast number of enterprises, established  
or expanded during monetary plenty, rapidly became unproductive when capital grew short.  
More realistic transport, fuel and food prices, and the return of rents to economic levels meant  
that wages, too, had to be raised substantially in real terms.

Firms that mushroomed during the inflation now found that the real interest they paid on loans  
for the first time was positive rather than negative, lower though the rates appeared to be.  
Perhaps most significant, for the first time they were obliged to pay real taxes, many of which  
were extremely high because of the necessity rapidly to balance the budget and to bring official

salaries, which had fallen disastrously, up to an acceptable level again. Companies were often  
unable to buy new machinery after stabilisation came, so much so that huge stocks of unsold iron  
and coal began to build up in the Ruhr. Not even the foreign loans flowing in were able to  
prevent the seizing up once again of the Ruhr mining industry where pit after pit, especially any  
producing poor quality coal, was forced to close. Workers were to flock from pit to agriculture,  
from mines and quarries and engineering to the production of food and direct consumer goods,  
and to building. Hugo Stinnes himself had been deceived by the artificial prosperity of inflation  
into a fanatical confidence in the future of coal. It was the post-stabilisation depression in the  
coal, iron and steel industries, contriving even the depopulation of Ruhr townships, which led  
eventually in June 1925 to the collapse of the Stinnes empire.

That event finally pricked the abscess. The great groups who had resisted over-expansion during  
the depreciation — Krupp, Thyssen, Gelsenkirchen — were able to ride the storm. Others such  
as the Sichel and Kahn groups foundered. The defects of 'vertical' industrial concentrations,  
embracing all stages of manufacture from raw material to finished article, had been revealed, the  
strength of horizontal combines confirmed. The speculators, in a word, found they had to pay for  
their folly, improvidence and greed; and the old captains of industry resumed their sway.

The Stinnes debacle demonstrated above all that great industrial possessions could not be held  
without adequate liquid resources (as early as June 1924, Stinnes had been trying to pledge  
Bochumer Verein and Gelsenkirchen shares against Dutch loans); and that vertical combines  
were inefficient and unprofitable except under the exceptional conditions which had bred them.

Germany which had undergone almost every conceivable form of collapse during the previous  
six years — military, political, social, financial, economic — now crashed downwards again just  
as her many times demoralised people had supposed that, with international help, she was  
beginning to rise from her knees. Confidence was shattered. The flow of foreign money  
slackened. The Reichs-bank policy of credit restriction was maintained as firmly as ever to  
counteract a net outflow of gold and foreign exchange. The shifting of the working population  
was accompanied by a new, terrifying increase in unemployment and short-time working.  
Because labour was a buyers' market, those with work were nonetheless often compelled to work  
a 54-hour week. There was such an alarming rise in the cost of living that to prevent agitation the  
index had to be cooked. And there was a new, spectacular toll of bankruptcies. Much though  
public works were instituted to try to mop up labour, the unemployed figure had passed  
1,300,000 by December 1925, and was gathering pace daily. The return of rational conditions  
had brought a necessary but brutal slimming of the immensely swollen public services: those  
who had been dismissed from the posts and the railways were now being joined not only by  
former miners and steel-workers but by the many who had started businesses on their own.

In the inflationary period new factories were built, old establishments reorganised and extended,  
new plant laid down, participations in all fields of industrial activity bought up, and the great  
amorphous concerns founded. Too late, it was found that this process had undermined the capital  
structure of the country: capital was frozen in factories for which, because of the extermination  
of the rentier and the reduction of the real wages of so many of the great consumer classes, there  
was no economic demand. Once the demand for goods was shut off and the flow of cash  
dammed, the fate of the productive apparatus was sealed. Even in 1924, firms of undoubted  
solidity and large assets were unable to pay out trifling sums of money. In 1926 that apparatus

was still too great in relation to the working capital and the nation's power of consumption. Thus,  
whereas in 1913 there were 7,700 bankruptcies, and in 1924 only 5,700, the figure for 1925 was  
10,800; and between the third quarter of 1925 and the second of 1927, bankruptcies numbered  
31,000 — a rate of 15,000 a year.

In practice, furthermore, a great many bankruptcies were refused by the courts in the absence of  
assets with which to meet claims. Between May and November 1925, the number of protested  
bills per week doubled from 2,691 to 5,406. Many banks were immobilised by having had to  
lend to their industrial customers who had had to be kept alive but now could not repay. The  
banks found it prohibitively hard and unrewarding to liquidate securities, and under those  
conditions were unwilling to take over bankrupt factories in lieu of money. With shares now at  
far below value in a moribund Stock Market, there were endless sellers and no buyers.

Where some firms went into liquidation, many others rationalised at the expense of the work  
force. The picture in the first week of December 1925 presented the politicians' nightmare of  
1922: the approach of the genuine, unhidden mass unemployment that the policy of inflation had  
so largely been designed to avoid. The mark stood steady. The franc, which before the war had  
been equal to the gold mark, was threatening to hit 150 to the pound. With France dumping  
currency and producing iron and steel more cheaply than her neighbours Germany was  
experiencing exactly what she had done to others, and finding it very unpleasant. Krupp had just  
dismissed 12,000 men, and dismissals on the same scale were being pursued by Mannesmann,  
Gelsenkirchen, Phoenix, the Prussian State Mines, and numerous other works. Thyssen was  
restricting output everywhere. Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz of Cologne had sacked hundreds and  
would close on December 15. Osram, the lamp makers, were on short-time. Various huge firms  
were winding themselves up for ever, while others were closing down for a number of weeks to  
await eventualities -- Rheinische Stahlwerke, for instance, and Bochumer Verein, some of the  
biggest names in German industry. The locomotive industry was producing 2 per cent of its pre-  
war output. The motor industry was in severe difficulties, too, with Benz deciding to close its  
works for a month and Opel dismissing 5,000 of its 7,000 workers.

During the first half of November there had been 145 bankruptcies in the textile industry, and  
now came report after report of closures and sackings. They were not confined to the Rhine-Ruhr  
area. In Saxony 179 factories producing metal, textiles, and machinery had been temporarily  
shut. In the Black Forest 65 per cent of the clockmakers were unemployed or on short time. The  
shipbuilding industry was employing half its pre-war and four-fifths of its 1924 numbers, and the  
tonnage launched was down accordingly. By February 1926 the number of registered  
unemployed soared over 2 million, with depression reaching from Hamburg to Bavaria. The  
average number of registered unemployed stayed at over 2 million throughout 1926 — otherwise  
a year of rationalisation, and of economic and industrial recovery -and was still at nearly 1.5  
million in December.\* (\*The average figure for both 1927 and 1928 was 1.4 million. The 1926  
figure, which seriously under-represents the true total of workless, would have been much  
greater had not the British miners' prolongation of the General Strike in the United Kingdom so  
enormously boosted the fortunes of the Ruhr mines.)

The industrial crises of 1926 at least spared the professional classes who had suffered so greatly  
in the financial one. By May of that year the circumstances of doctors, lawyers, professors and  
writers and the like had radically changed. They were again able to live in circumstances

appropriate to their cultural environment: their fees were being paid, and their services were  
required in full measure. By 1927, when all Germany in an outburst of physical exercise and  
gymnasticism attempted to become 'strong and beautiful', the standard of living of the masses,  
too, had become very high, with individual prosperity as superficially evident as the municipal  
and national. Only the legions of unemployable whose substance had been dissipated and the  
hundreds of thousands of workers for whom there was no work bore the outward scars of the  
great inflation and spoilt an otherwise happy picture.

### 15: The Wounds are Bared

THE depth and permanence of the inward scars borne by the whole nation were perhaps harder  
to judge. The scourge of inflation, it must be emphasised again, followed the scourge of defeat in  
war, so that one must hesitate to affirm that the psychological trauma of the early 19208 would  
have been absent but for the social and economic insecurity which the endless depreciation of the  
currency brought. National disintegration and social upheavals unconnected with the money  
supply, after all, are in general enough to promote ethical degeneration and contempt for the old  
standards of behaviour in any community. It remains the case that those who lived with, or who  
observed, the inflationary process and the crisis of the recovery readily attributed what they saw  
first and foremost to the inflation: the fear, the greed, the immorality, the demoralisation, the  
dishonour.

Throughout the later inflationary years the shrill argument had gone on over who was to blame  
and what was the cause of the unceasing, increasing financial crisis — never a true crisis because  
instead of coming to a head it always did the impossible by getting even worse. Month upon  
month every excuse was found for it but the right one; every attempt made to stem the fall of the  
mark but the fundamental one. Mirabeau would have been no more heeded then than he was  
when, a few months before his death and a year before the Revolution's notorious assignats were  
introduced, he delivered the famous peroration to his speech on the French financial situation:  
'La banqueroute, la hideuse banqueroute, est la. Elle menace de consumer vous, vos proprietes,  
votre honneur — et vous deliberez!'.

What Frau Eisenmenger had observed in Austria, Judith List-owel, not yet grown up, watched in  
Hungary — how want and loss of status had led to the fall of ethical standards, to family  
quarrels, and to communal hatred, especially against the Jews. Judith List-owel retains no  
illusions about how her family reacted to the financial crises that lasted into 1924 and beyond,  
and rejects the generalisation that during the inflationary months everyone spent their whole time  
looking around for material goods in which to reinvest their savings.

My relations and friends were too stupid. They didn't understand what inflation meant. They  
didn't rush to get rid of their money (that was what the Jews and the Germans did). All my  
relations thought it would stop the next week — and they went on thinking so.

They woke up very late. They started selling their valuables because they couldn't buy food —  
the china from the mantelpiece, the furniture, the silver. That made them think — it made them  
think when the price of a set of old silver spoons went up from 20,000 to 40,000 crowns in a  
matter of a week or two. And if you had to sell a valuable writing desk for money which was  
worth only half as much a week later, of course there was ill-feeling.

It was resented when Jews bought these things. The Jewish women would turn up at parties or at  
the dansants when we were all broke, wearing the silver fox furs — three at a time for  
ostentation -- and diamonds which they had bought from our relations for a song — or what,  
when they saw them again, had become a song. My relations didn't know the value of anything.  
They were stupid. Our solicitors were no better. My mother's bank manager gave her appalling  
advice — he didn't know what he was talking about either.

Anti-Semitism had been negligible before inflation. Although Bela Kun's revolution had been  
mainly run by Jews, the White Terror had largely purged political resentment. The Jews had  
been badly treated in Hungary since the 1860s, and were not received socially for many years.  
Nine out of ten bore grudges, and when the opportunity of impressing the arrogant gentiles  
arrived at last, who was to blame them for taking it? When they made a success of inflation, they  
were hated. When they were ostentatious about it, they were hated even more. It may have been  
stupid of them, and of course the wiser Jews, especially the older ones, were greatly upset, and  
remonstrated with the younger, because they foresaw the antagonism their behaviour would  
create.

The Jews probably paid fair prices for what they bought — but that wasn't the point. Except for  
my father and many of his generation, people hated the Jews. My father realised that the fault did  
not lie with the Jews but somehow much higher up. Of course, it would be wrong to give the  
impression that there were not many impoverished Jews in Budapest and other places who had  
got things just as wrong as everybody else.

Compared with elsewhere, the elite branches of the Hungarian civil service — the Army, the  
diplomatic corps, and the financial administration — usually maintained the old traditions of  
integrity; and they suffered for that. The families of senior civil servants who tried to stick to the  
ethics of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy often met disaster — unless they had land with which  
to support their convictions — and the attitudes of such parents were often resented by the young  
who found the maintenance of uncomfortable principles objectionable while their friends'  
families were obviously making compromises.

Real corruption was found less in the central government than at county level. This was  
something entirely new. When my father protested about the irregularities that were permitted -  
the keeping of two sets of books, the acceptance of bribes, the payments in cash, the extra jobs  
taken on which left less time for official work to be done — the reply was: 'Your Excellency,  
will you feed my children?'

There was communal hatred, which was new. There was social resentment, which was new.  
There was bribery and corruption: that was new. It was the same in Austria and Poland. If you  
get the same fever, you get the same symptoms.

Nor was German honour inflation-proof. The corruption among officials in 1924, Lord  
D'Abernon reported, was 'appalling', whereas before the war bribery had been almost unknown,  
and a high degree of uncorruptibility evident in public and private, if not always in commercial,  
life. There were few in any class of society who were not infected by, or prey to, the pervasive,  
soul-destroying influence of the constant erosion of capital or earnings and uncertainty about the  
future. From tax-evasion, food-hoarding, currency speculation, or illegal exchange transactions  
— all crimes against the State, each of which to a greater or less degree became for individuals a  
matter of survival — it was a short step to breaching one or other of the Ten Commandments.  
Whereas the lower classes with the further goad of unemployment might turn to theft and similar  
crimes (the figures up by almost 50 per cent in 1923 over 1913 and 1925) or to prostitution, the  
middle and upper classes under a different kind of strain would resort to graft and fraud, bribing,  
bribable. Once bribery was the norm, by definition normal people resorted to it, the more so in  
the months of abject scarcity. No people could be expected to remain unconcerned while huge

profits and riotous luxury were ostentatiously being enjoyed by the few. Corruption bred  
corruption, and the Civil Service caught the infection even in the war years. Counterfeiting was  
widespread.

As the old virtues of thrift, honesty and hard work lost their appeal, everybody was out to get  
rich quickly, especially as speculation in currency or shares could palpably yield far greater  
rewards than labour. While the anonymous, mindless Republic in the shape of the Reichsbank  
was prepared to be the dupe of borrowers, no industrialist, businessman or merchant would have  
wished to let the opportunities for enrichment slip by while others were making hay. For the less  
astute, it was incentive enough, and arguably morally defensible, to play the markets and take  
every advantage of the unworkable fiscal system merely to maintain one's financial and social  
position.

As that position slid away, patriotism, social obligations and morals slid away with it. The ethic  
cracked. Willingness to break the rules reflected the common attitude. Not to be able to hold on  
to what one had, or what one had saved, little as it worried those who had nothing, was a very  
real basis of the human despair from which jealousy, fear and outrage were not far removed.

The air of corruption in business, politics, and the public service, then, was general. The share  
capital abuses that became common as more and more shares were concentrated in the hands of  
profiteers were no more than an example, although a serious one, of the moral deterioration  
caused by inflation — they largely disappeared when stable money was restored. In an article in  
the New York World written in the summer of 1933, Stresemann rather defensively suggested  
that 'our whole business life has acquired the character of dishonesty and corruption because the  
value of the mark in June does not happen to be the same as the value in July'. More privately he  
admitted that the substance and the shadow of improbity were the same.

Most people were aware that willy-nilly their standards had fallen. 'It is the ordinary conditions  
of our life that make a woman evil,' said Erna von Pustau. Agonising over a peccadillo, she  
supposed that her 'callousness was just part of the general moral decay.' Frau von Eisenmenger's  
diary equally contained repeated regrets about the deceits into which life was forcing her. Her  
stock of good cigars enabled her to obtain a transport permit from the Volkswehr, normally  
forbidden to the bourgeoisie: but business was done in transport permits as in anything else. She  
shared philosophic resentment about the behaviour of others:

The growing lack of consideration for one's fellow men ... impresses me very painfully. I can  
understand, however, that the instinct of self-preservation in people whose very existence is  
threatened should overcome all moral laws ... It has become common for better and more  
warmly clad people to be robbed of their clothes in the street, and obliged to go home barefoot.

However, she had less sympathy for the President of the Salzburg Provincial Government who  
was arrested for illicit trading in government property — food, leather and clothes: 'These are the  
enemies in our camp, but how few of them are detected!'

In Germany not until well after the return to stability did the nature and extent of the corruption  
in high places begin to be known. Events like the sentencing in March 1924 to three years' gaol  
of Dr Zeigner, the egregious ex-Premier of Saxony, for corrupt practices and bribery had raised

scarcely a ripple. The end of the year brought to light a far more formidable array of financial  
scandals, enough to confirm the view that the old universal integrity had sunk in the whirlpool of  
inflation, and to deliver another stunning blow to the nation's morale.

The Barmat and Kutisker affairs which then rocked the country and shocked the world unfolded  
backwards like an Ibsen drama, the ramifications of malfeasance going further and higher the  
more stones were lifted up. A curious feature was that with each fresh series of arrests a dementi  
was issued by the incriminated declaring their innocence, in every case only to be confronted by  
irrefutable evidence to the contrary. The press, particularly the Nationalist newspapers, tried to  
make political capital out of the grave embarrassment of the government, many of whom were  
personally involved — until the arrest of highly-placed Prussian officials of the old regime  
showed all too plainly that corruption was not a Republican monopoly.

Iwan Kutisker was a Lithuanian Jew who moved into Germany at the time of the German  
revolution and recognised at once the characteristic principles of inflation. Starting with the  
modest sum he had amassed at home in dollars during the German occupation, he acquired a  
bank and directorships of a number of well-known firms, and immediately became financially  
influential in his new milieu. By 1923, the bank was hard hit by inflation, but not so hard that it  
could not be very accommodating towards the Chief of the Passport Office of the Ministry of the  
Interior, one Herr Bartels. Kutisker was also obliging to Bartels in the matter of indicating to him  
which aliens shoulds be expelled from the country. One such alien was a fellow Lithuanian  
called Holzmann who in 1924, although he had provided a security worth half a million gold  
marks, could not repay Kutisker a sum of 200,000 gold marks advanced in the heady days of the  
inflation. Unwilling to be sent home on such a pretext, Holzmann preferred to take public issue  
with his countryman, and from then on the inglorious tale of graft and blackmail began to unfold.  
In November 1924, Bartels was arrested for bribery and corruption.

Julius Barmat was a notorious swindler who, though no less than Kutisker a Russian Jew of  
Lithuanian extraction, acquired in 1921 a certificate from the Prussian Ministry of the Interior  
instructing the authorities on the Dutch frontier that he and six other members of the Barmat  
family belonged to the Dutch legation in Berlin and that the usual customs formalities were to be  
waived in their case. The minister in question was later to assert that he had only acted on a  
direct request from the then Chancellor Fehrenbach's office.

The four Barmat brothers were directors of the Barmat Konzern, which had interests in 45  
industrial and banking businesses. One brother had given a good deal of public offence by  
ostentatiously occupying a mansion in the lake-girt island of Schwanenwerder where he kept a  
flotilla of motor launches. Each of the others owned one or more palatial residences; and the  
vulgarity of all was a byword, noted even by those leading Social Democrat deputies who  
(according to the Right-wing Vorwarts) frequently enjoyed their hospitality.

Inflation profiteering had consisted of borrowing paper marks, converting them into goods and  
factories, and then repaying the lenders with depreciated paper. It was a process of which both  
Kutisker and the Barmats were pastmasters. Deflation profiteering, whose possibilities these  
Lithuanians (unlike Stinnes) rapidly saw, consisted of selling everything available for the new  
stable marks and — in this period of the tightest imaginable credit — lending the proceeds at  
extravagant rates of interest.

It was not entirely necessary to sell something first. Julius Barmat and a Frankfort Jew named  
Jacob Michael, one of the few postwar' speculators whose pile was mainly made after  
stabilisation and who had been among the first to unload shares in exchange for cash,\* found  
themselves in ostensible dispute about a certain sum of money. Together they approached the  
president and board of directors of the Prussian State Bank with the request that they would  
arbitrate between them in return for a small percentage of the money involved. The bank itself  
was among the oldest and most respected in the country, the epitome of financial discipline and  
rectitude, and one which, because of its strict avoidance of speculation, had not had its solidity  
undermined by the inflation. Its higher officers, too, the elite of the old order, enjoyed a very  
special confidence.

\*and who was a sometime owner of the notorious dump of war material at Hanau, some miles in  
extent, popularly used as co-lateral for massive loans.

THE WOUNDS ARE BARED

Perhaps none was more surprised than the bank's president, Herr von Dombois, and the two bank  
directors, Geheimrat Rühe and Ministerial-Director Hellwig, who together were to form the  
arbitration panel, to find that the sum in dispute was extraordinarily big and that the percentage  
they eventually received amounted to nearly 40,000 gold marks. Be that as it might, large credits  
from the Seehandlung — the common name for the Prussian State Bank — began to flow in the  
direction of both Barmat and Kutisker, and at a time when money was so scarce that the Finance  
Minister and the President of the Reichsbank, Luther and Schacht, were daily appealing to  
commerce and industry to respect the restrictions imposed. Elsewhere when even the best  
securities would not release a pfennig, the two families of Lithuanian Jewish adventurers on the  
most questionable securities were able to borrow 50 million gold marks from the Seehandlung at  
from 10 per cent to 18 per cent, and to re-lend them at between 100 and 200 per cent.

Following up the leads discovered in the process of the arrest of Bartels, the bank's president and  
the two directors were apprehended just after Christmas 1924. The most prominent of these  
gentlemen, Dr Rühe, the Financial Director of the Prussian State, was charged with conspiracy  
with Kutisker. The president of the bank was removed from his post, the Seehandlung accounts  
having been found to be showing a loss of some 15 million marks; and Kutisker and the Barmats  
were arrested as well.

These scandals led to more disclosures. The Seehandlung was not the only concern which had  
enjoyed the Barmats' patronage. It was found that the Reich Post Office had in the course of the  
year advanced to Julius Barmat a total of 15 million gold marks, and that credits had been issued  
personally by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Dr Hofle, although three signatures were  
officially required on the cheques. Hofle resigned his position on January 9 and was suspended  
from membership of the Reichstag along with another prominent member of the Centre Party.

Three hundred police took part in the 30 or 40 arrests which followed — 13 of State officials.  
Other bankers from the Seehandlung were hauled in, including Herr Kautz, formerly a councillor  
with the Ministry of Finance. Herr Richter, the Social Democrat President of the Berlin Police  
admitted to having opened an account with the Barmat bank in the same circumstances as  
Bartels. Herr Friedlander of the old-established bank of Hoffman and Fried-lander killed himself

with an overdose of veronal on learning of the arrest of his stepson, a director of one of Barmat's  
offshoots.

On and on along the higher corridors of power went the trail. It was discovered that a  
confidential report on the Barmats had disappeared from the Foreign Office; and so had a minute  
to the former Chancellor Scheidemann from Reichsprasident Ebert himself, asking him to help  
Barmat. It was found that the Post Office had lent 5 million more gold marks to another  
unspecified client. The bank's loans to Jacob Michael were discovered too. Although President  
Ebert himself was only implicated by rumour, his son was deeply involved.

Our good friend 'der brave Joseph' \[wrote Addison in reference to Dr Wirth, the ex-Chancellor\]  
who posed as the embodiment of Parsifal-like ignorance of the wicked world and of transparent  
honesty, is said to be in it up to the hilt, in as much as through his agency his own company  
succeeded in extracting a trifle of 14 million gold marks out of the Post Office funds. To name  
the others would be to give a complete list of all the Social Democrat leaders and of the most  
highly placed officials ... The Right are biting their fists with rage that all this didn't come out  
before the December election.

Yet it was equally believed that the Nationalists were involved as well. The sums involved were  
immense — upwards of £2 million in bribes over and above initial loans. The veniality of the  
bank's permanent officials facilitated the Seehandlung transaction, and bribery or political  
influence those of the Post Office. Subversion, in short, had been general, and no one questioned  
that much of the iceberg still lay below the surface. The whole miserable story was to have its  
echoes four years later when the Sklarek Brothers scandal broke, involving massive bribery of  
the Berlin municipality, including the Chief Burgomaster, by a firm of tailors. The Barmat-  
Kutisker episode, at any rate, indicated an advanced state of corruption in the higher official  
class, doubtless due to the general demoralisation that the prolonged financial chaos had  
produced as well as to the inadequate salaries which were paid during the months which  
immediately followed Germany's financial reconstruction.

The year 1925 was otherwise marked by two events important in German history, the succession  
of Hindenburg in April as President of the Reich and the Treaty of Locarno, signed in December.  
Neither was viewed with much more than minority approval. The flow of American funds into  
the country, however — £200 million between 1924 and 1926 alone, £1,000 million by 1929 —  
though interrupted from time to time, from then on induced a spirit of state and municipal — and  
then personal — extravagance as to make the American Mr Parker Gilbert, the Reparations  
Agent-General in Berlin, wonder how the country's foreign debts were ever going to be repaid,  
however much those loans were being used to meet reparations payments under the Dawes plan  
as they became due. Dr Schacht was loudly critical of public spending policy. Dr Strese-mann,  
the Foreign Minister, wrote to the Mayor of Duisburg:

The fact that the Prussian State has granted 14 million marks for the rebuilding of the Berlin  
Opera House, and will perhaps raise it to 20 million, creates the impression in the world that we  
are rolling in money ... Dresden builds a Museum of Hygiene with the help of a Reich subsidy  
... Please tell me what I am to say to the representatives of foreign powers when they tell me that  
all these things awaken the impression that Germany won rather than lost the war.

No one was disposed to take much notice. Traders asserted, of course, that business had been  
made unprofitable owing to the heavy charges of the State, but there remained among those who  
had survived the shake-out of 1925 both a deep satisfaction at the improvement in the country's  
finances and a firm confidence that henceforward life would be better. It was in this mood not  
only that the savings habit returned to a people who had learnt the hard way as individuals to rid  
themselves of cash at the earliest opportunities, but that the habit of borrowing, acquired during  
the inflationary period, set in more fiercely than ever.

That the federal states should have taken the lead was not an unnatural development, for with the  
solid proceeds of a working taxation system boosted by lavish foreign loans, public spending  
sprees were possible on a scale unknown since before the war. The states and the municipalities  
were making up for what they had missed during the inflationary period when roles were  
reversed and private industrial interests had flourished at their expense. Much expenditure on  
public building programmes was designed expressly to mop up unemployment.

The high interest rates of 1926 may have given businessmen cause to hesitate, but hardly  
prevented the wholesale 'rationalisation' which was to characterise the pre-slump years. The big  
industrialists formed cartels, first nationally and then internationally, to keep prices high. The  
federal states could only hope to make their own interest payments on foreign loans provided  
that more loans kept on coming — and soon the easy long-term loans were replaced by stiffer  
short-term ones. In the practice of borrowing, smaller firms and entrepreneurs were obliged to  
follow the lead of the big industrialists and the public bodies; and before long even the peasants  
were as badly in debt as the municipalities. Public and private light-headedness about money  
matters, in a word, was one of the legacies of inflation, and a deadly one to have acquired.

A member of the British Foreign Office staff returned from a travelling holiday all over  
Germany in August 1926. The German middle and lower classes, he reported, had money to  
spend freely. They were able to travel about in multitudes. All were 'decently and newly though  
hideously clad' in clothes dearer in Germany than in Britain. The cafes and places of amusement  
were full to the brim, although neither refreshments nor amusements were noticeably cheap.  
Museums, picture galleries and castles were crowded with German trippers, paying entrance  
money of sometimes two or three marks a head. Festivals of all kinds were being organised by  
both municipal and state governments, all putting up expensive new exhibition buildings and  
depending on German, not foreign tourists to survive. Although he observed that there were  
many formerly well-off still in straitened circumstances, he saw no reason to reduce the annuities  
payable under the Dawes plan: Strese-mann's fears of jaundiced foreign eyes were entirely  
justified.

The false prosperity of post-inflation Germany, the second onset of massive economic self-  
deception within the decade, but in this case flowering over great unemployment below, was a  
poor psychological prelude to the slump conditions to come. Indeed, the inflation experience  
itself had ensured that the human emergencies of an economic depression could not be met by  
any German Government with even a modicum of monetary flexibility. 'It is easy enough to  
understand why the record of the sad years 1919-1923 always weighs like a nightmare on the  
German people,' ran Bresciani-Turroni's summary.

Democracy may have survived inflation, but there was little enough evidence of universal  
gratitude for that deliverance. Mon-archism was the more popular creed, and it may be that the  
exposure to the air of Germany's moral wounds — the financial scandals of the inflationary years  
— contributed greatly to the strengthening of the disciplinarian side of the nation's character.  
Lord D'Abernon, who with Dr Stresemann had been a principal architect of the Locarno Pact  
which was designed to bring Germany back into a world of civilised co-existence, viewed the  
country through spectacles of the bleakest realism:

If one drives on a Sunday afternoon through any German province there is always the same sight  
to be seen — men of every age and every corpulence, similarly dressed, marching rigidly in  
rank, accompanied by bands and banners, and the applause of their attendant womankind and  
young. They represent every school of political thought, and one will see in the same hour  
companies of country squires with their tenants and retainers and 'proletarian centuries'  
performing the same evolutions and carrying with the same invincible solemnity the emblems of  
Imperial Germany and Revolutionary Russia. It is thus not astonishing that there are in this  
country great numbers of ordinary mankind — excellent fathers and husbands of families — who  
can think of foreign politics only in terms of war.

Lord D'Abernon found the same atavism still more crudely illustrated in the treatment of treason  
cases in the German courts, in which the judges, ordinarily men of broad views and enlightened  
humanity, would inflict sentences of a savagery (he said) that would leave Englishmen aghast.\*  
(It is of course a commonplace that crimes threatening the survival of a society are found more  
odious by that society than those which threaten, or actually end, the survival of its members;  
and that in many communities, including Britain, treason has remained a capital offence where  
murder has not. — A.F.) 'It would be straining ambition too far,' he concluded, 'to hope that in  
such a paste as this the leaven of Locarno will work anything but slowly.'

The aggressive posturing of the extreme, reactionary, militarist groups may have cooled  
somewhat since the disappearance of the inflationary conditions in which they had so notably  
flourished; but party discipline was still strong, and the political strength of the Nationalist  
parties in and out of the Reichstag grew steadily. Reparations, the 'war guilt lie', and the  
continued occupation of the Rhineland were still the targets and rallying causes of the Right.  
Hindenburg's election, though perhaps primarily the result of national sentimental sympathy for  
an old field-marshal who had had the misfortune to lose a great war, as well as of clever timing  
and a measure of ruthless machination, had given a decided fillip to the Nationalist and  
monarchist movements. To some he appeared to herald a reversion to a 'Prussian' Germany.

Germany, wrote General Wauchope\*\* (Later General Sir Arthur Wauchope. He had commanded  
the 2nd Bn the Black Watch, and was from 1924-1927 Chief of the British Section Military  
Inter-Allied Commission of Control, Berlin.) in a memorandum to London at the beginning of  
1927, was morally mobilised for a war in the future to right the wrongs of the Treaty of  
Versailles.

The greatest loss which Germany suffered was the ruin of her middle classes. If her 'natural  
leaders' are now to be found in the present party of the Right, Germany may again become a  
danger. It is common knowledge that great numbers of factories could be rapidly reorganised as  
in 1914-1915 for the production of war material if the government wished. Many are so overbuilt

at present that they could produce a large military as well as a large commercial output. The last  
war showed that in time of need output per man could be made to increase.

Already, Wauchope pointed out, output per man in Germany, although 40 per cent below that in  
the United States, and only 90 per cent of what had been achieved pre-war, was 40 per cent  
above output per man in Britain. He deduced that there was a fair chance of having to fight a new  
war with Germany 'within the life of this generation', and had watched with awe the great  
attempts at physical culture going on throughout Germany to prepare the nation for future  
struggles.

It was, indeed, a matter of general remark among Allied observers that the German labourer  
worked for considerably longer for less than his British counterpart, and did so unremittingly,  
except for the usual pauses, during the whole of his working hours, unhampered by any trade  
union restrictions as to the quantity of his output. For the French particularly, the confinement in  
the middle of the disunited, work-shy, war-weary western nations of an energetic, well-organised  
block of 60 million industrious and martially-minded people, overflowing with self-justification  
and aspiring to the position of pre-eminence they thought their due, constituted a serious cause  
for alarm. The existence of ill-suppressed revanchism and the highly expert nuclear Reichswehr  
which von Seeckt had salvaged from the wreck of the war were additional reasons for the fears  
which, of course, events were fully to justify.

Epilogue

THE economic causes of the German inflation appeared long before the Treaty of Versailles. Its  
psychological effects were felt long after the Treaty of Locarno. Where did the story end? Not  
with the stabilisation recovery, for that, too, was an episode in a human tragedy; not in the  
following years of sham prosperity founded on foreign loans which were at last called in; not in  
the disastrous years of 1930, 1931 or 1932, when economists, historians and politicians were  
even then rushing into print to write finis to the aftermath of the Great War.

More than any other thread that links the two world wars, the history of the inflation is a  
reminder that for the nation which supremely promoted both of them, the second was merely an  
extension of the first, reinforcing the adage that the seeds of battle are planted in peace treaties.  
Inflation for Germany was an unwitting part of the process of stoking the emotional boilers for a  
resumption of hostilities when the power to wage war returned. Not only did the loss of their  
former affluence and status, and the destruction of the old moral ethic, sour and humiliate the  
human pillars and foundations of German society: in German minds democracy and  
Republicanism had become so associated with financial, social and political disorder as to render  
any alternatives preferable when disorder threatened again.

When war came back, so did inflation. With inflation alone, noted Günter Schmolders,\* (The  
German Experience', essay in Inflation (Ed. C. Lowell Harriss, The Acad. of Polit. Science, New  
York, vol 31, IV, I975.)) can a government extinguish debt without repayment, or wage war and  
engage in other non-productive activities on a large scale: it is still not recognised as a tax by the  
tax-payer. Thus did Hitler resume deficit spending to finance armaments in 1938, and the  
experience begin again. As in the first case, the second inflation was a ten-year affair, although  
huge price inflation did not start in earnest until the eighth and ninth years, when cigarettes took  
over as the medium of exchange.

In terms of public perception, however, the second inflation travelled much faster. By 1948 the  
Reichsmark was abandoned, and ten Reichsmarks were traded in in cash against the new  
Deutschmark, while bank accounts were credited with only 6.50 Deutschmarks for every 100  
Reichsmarks. Disaster had struck the holders of money values once again, but the agony was  
contained very much more quickly. The pass to which the Reichsmark had come in 1947-1948,  
the loss of nine-tenths of its value, had been achieved by its predecessor, the mark, as early as

Her new war indemnities apart, Germany was once again an almost debt-free country; and once  
again, with stability regained, great foreign loans were available to haul her out of her economic  
difficulties. Once again the repudiation of debt, conscious or unconscious, had been shown to be  
no more than a stage on the hyper-inflationary road. In the Toronto Star Weekly in December  
1923, Ernest Hemingway described a street auction of inflation banknotes -- German marks,  
Austrian kronen, Russian roubles — which the citizens of Toronto were being urged to buy in  
the hope, of which Germans, Austrians and Russians had long since been brutally robbed, that  
when sanity returned the banknotes, too, would retrieve their old values:

No one explained to the listening men that the cheap-looking Russian money had been printed in  
million-rouble denominations as fast as the presses could work in order to wipe out the value of  
the old imperial money and in consequence the money-holding class. Now the Soviet has issued  
roubles backed by gold. None of these in the hands of the barkers ...

To say that inflation caused Hitler, or by extension that a similar inflation elsewhere than in a  
Weimar Germany could produce other Right or Left wing dictatorships, is to wander into  
quagmires of irrelevant historical analogy. The comparable, coincidental, financial and social  
circumstances of Austria and Hungary do not, in any case, support such a notion, telling in other  
matters as are some of the parallels which may be found. On the other hand, the vast  
unemployment of the early 19305 gave Hitler the votes he needed. Just as the scale of that  
unemployment was part of the economic progression originating in the excesses of the  
inflationary years, so the considerable successes of the Nazi party immediately after stabilisation  
and immediately before the recession were linked (pace the observations of the Consul-General  
Clive) with its advances in 1922 and 1923.

It is indisputable that in those inflationary years Hitler felt his political strength as a national  
figure and first tried his fingers for size on the throat of German democracy. Indeed, as Mr Clive  
perceptively reported, 'in the course of 1923 he succeeded in rousing more passions and stirring  
up more bad blood than far greater men than he have done in a lifetime.' The Consul-General  
might with justification have added that Hitler should go far. Germany only needed a new dose  
of economic misfortune for the Nazis to seize power, quasi-constitutionally, the second time  
round.

Inflation did not conjure up Hitler, any more than he, as it happened, conjured it. But it made  
Hitler possible. It is daring to say that without it Hitler would have achieved nothing: but so is it  
daring to assert that, had enormous post-war unemployment not been held at bay for years by  
financing the government's deficits and by an ungoverned credit policy, bloody revolution would  
have occurred, leading presumably to an equally bloody civil war whose outcome can only be  
guessed at. In all these matters, it was anyway touch and go.

That Germany inflated deliberately in order to avoid the costs of reparations is not a proposition  
that bears examination. The evidence is wholly against it. First, the rate of inflation was  
enormous long before reparations were an issue. Secondly, industrial pressure to inflate, largely  
self-interested, had nothing directly to do with the war debt. Thirdly, it was correctly recognised  
that, although customs receipts by the Allies were perforce in paper money, reparations had to be  
paid either in kind or in gold equivalents: British and French war debts to America had  
themselves to be rendered in gold or gold equivalents, America's high tariffs making payment in  
goods impracticable.

Fourthly, at no time did Germany's financial authorities so much as hint, privately or publicly,  
that their policies derived from cynicism (which would have had to be shared by their  
counterparts in Austria and Hungary) rather than incomprehension and incapacity. That the  
government and the Reichsbank were dominated by the notion that a huge 'passive' balance of  
payments made constant devaluation inevitable hardly seems sufficient explanation of their total,  
blind refusal to connect the mark's depreciation with the money supply — yet, as Lord  
D'Abernon wrote even in 1922: 'Knowledge of currency laws -- particularly of the quantitative

theory — is incredibly absent in all German circles'; or, as Brescioni-Turroni noted, the  
budgeting deficits of Reich and states alike were considered by writers and politicians 'not the  
cause, but the consequence of the external depreciation of the mark.'

It is irrelevant to this that the German workers who produced the reparation payments in goods  
or in bills of exchange were paid for their efforts in depreciating paper, with considerable though  
transient advantages for German industry and commerce — and frequently to the disadvantage  
of their foreign competitors. To that extent, reparations encouraged inflation. The 'transfer  
problem', involving the adverse economic effects of reparations on creditor countries, was only  
hesitantly being recognised by the Allies in the spring of 1923; and until then it was not  
suggested by them (or feared by German industrialists) that the excessive sale of subsidised  
exports for reparation payment purposes might lead to the erection of tariff barriers against  
Germany, much as other forms of Valutadumping' were castigated.\* (Schacht, in My First  
Seventy-Six Years, Chap 21, reports Reginald McKenna, formerly Asquith's Chancellor of the  
Exchequer and then, in 1923, Chairman of the Midland Bank, as saying: 'Since Germany can  
only make payments by means of exports, she would be compelled to export to such an extent  
that British industry would suffer intolerably.')

While the reparations burden and the uncertainties it led to were advanced as a cause of inflation,  
so was inflation pressed as one of the conditions which made reparations difficult to pay — and  
in both claims there was a certain justice, although neither told more than a fraction of the story.  
D'Abernon, who did not exonerate the French government under Poincare from some of the  
blame for Germany's financial troubles (he accused Paris alternatively of 'Shylockism, bad  
information, or possibly, profound policy'), roundly condemned Berlin's 'folly and ignorance'.  
Indeed, it was inconceivable that Germany ever knowingly embarked on a course of economic  
and financial suicide to escape war indemnities, or that such motives were entertained by  
Rathenau. In practice, inflation proved no means of escaping foreign obligations except in so far  
as it contributed to the economic collapse of 1932 which wrecked the reparations programme for  
good.

The Reichsbank's display of naivete in its credit policies of 1922 and 1923 should finally dispel  
any suspicions of financial Machiavellianism on the part of Havenstein and his associates. They  
staunchly denied that higher discount rates would moderate the inflation and, on the contrary,  
opined that they would merely raise the costs of production and push up prices further. Loudly as  
they later asserted that these inexplicably cheap credits were given principally for 'profitable'  
projects, the favoured firms who benefitted from this largesse turned the money to their best  
advantage — either by turning it into material assets or into foreign exchange, or simply using it  
to speculate against the mark and drive it downwards. The only financial conditions which  
Havenstein understood were those which prevailed before 1914.

How great does inflation have to be before a government can no longer control it? Most  
economists accept that mild inflation has certain therapeutic advantages for a nation which must  
deal with the social and economic problems to which industrial democracies are usually subject.  
Most electorates still accept the statements of their politicians' pious intentions in regard to  
controlling ever rising prices: and yet the Deutschmark, the currency of the country which had  
most reason to fear inflation, lost two-thirds of its purchasing power between 1948 and 1975.  
The pound lost almost half its purchasing power between 1970 and 1975. In neither instance,

however, did such depreciation represent a deliberate, cynical policy; which, no doubt, would  
also have been claimed by the German bankers and governments of the early 1920, who looked  
for causes of their monetary difficulties beyond their own printing press and tax system — and  
found them, without difficulty and to their complete intellectual satisfaction. It remains so that  
once an inflation is well under way (as Schmb'lders has it) 'it develops a powerful lobby that has  
no interest in rational arguments.' This was as true for Austria and Hungary as for Germany.

There was no moment in Germany between 1914 and the summer of 1923 when in theory  
currency stability could not have been secured, if necessary by the establishment of a new bank  
of issue for which sufficient backing was still available. Until the later date, despite the demands  
made by the Entente and the necessity to find substitutes for the Ruhr's iron and coal, German  
gold and foreign currency reserves always constituted a substantial proportion of the exchange  
value of the circulating paper, no matter how fantastically its volume grew. After the war was  
over, however, there were always practical difficulties which had little to do with the refusal of  
Germany's monetary authorities to see the connection between depreciation and money supply.

Long before the Ruhr invasion, and perhaps even before the preliminary meetings of the  
Reparations Commission, there came a stage when it was politically impossible to hah inflation.  
In the middle of 1920, after the brief post-Kapp Putsch period of the mark's stability, the  
competitiveness of German exports declined, with unemployment beginning to build up as a  
result. The point was presumably not lost on the inflators. Recovery of the mark could not be  
achieved without immediate repercussions in terms of bankruptcies, redundancies, short-time  
working, unemployment, strikes, hunger, demonstrations, Communist agitation, violence, the  
collapse of civil order, and thus (so it was believed) insurrection and revolution itself.

Much as it may have been recognised that stability would have to be arranged some day, and that  
the greater the delay the harder it would be, there never seemed to be a good time to invite  
trouble of that order. Day by day through 1920, 1921 and 1922 the reckoning was postponed, the  
more (not the less) readily as the prospective consequences of inflation became more frightening.  
The conflicting objectives of avoiding unemployment and avoiding insolvency ceased at last to  
conflict when Germany had both.

The longer the delay, the more savage the cure. Austria by the end of 1922 was in the hands of  
the receivers, having regained a stable currency only under the absolute direction of a foreigner.  
Hungary, too, had passed any chance of self-redemption, and later on was to undergo an equal  
degree of hardship and suffering, especially for her public servants. Stability returned to  
Germany under a military dictatorship when much of the constitution had been suspended --  
although the State of Emergency was only indirectly necessitated by the destruction of the  
nation's finances. To all three countries stability and then recovery came. All had to be bailed out  
by others. Each was obliged to accept a greater degree of economic disruption and  
unemployment than need ever have been feared at the time when the excessive printing of  
banknotes might still have been stopped. In all three cases, after inflation reached a certain  
advanced stage, financial and economic disaster seems to have been a prerequisite of recovery.

The take-off point in the inflationary progress, after which the advent of hyperinflation was but a  
matter of time, the point indeed when it became self-generating and politically irreducible except  
for short periods, was not indeed to be found on the graph of the currency depreciation, or of the

velocity of its circulation, or of the balance of payments deficit. Nor in Germany's case did it  
notably coincide with some ultimate crisis of confidence in the mark, at home or abroad —  
Rathenau's murder, or the occupation of the Rhine ports, or the London Ultimatum, all of which  
had immediate seismic effects upon it. Rather it lay on the falling curve of political possibility,  
with which was closely linked the degree of political power and courage that the government,  
sorely pressed as it was, was able to muster.

What really broke Germany was the constant taking of the soft political option in respect of  
money. The take-off point therefore was not a financial but a moral one; and the political excuse  
was despicable, for no imaginable political circumstances could have been more unsuited to the  
imposition of a new financial order than those pertaining in November 1923, when inflation was  
no longer an option. The Rentenmark was itself hardly more than an expedient then, and could  
scarcely have been introduced successfully had not the mark lost its entire meaning. Stability  
came only when the abyss had been plumbed, when the credible mark could fall no more, when  
everything that four years of financial cowardice, wrong-headedness and mismanagement had  
been fashioned to avoid had in fact taken place, when the inconceivable had ineluct-ably arrived.

Money is no more than a medium of exchange. Only when it has a value acknowledged by more  
than one person can it be so used. The more general the acknowledgement, the more useful it is.  
Once no one acknowledged it, the Germans learnt, their paper money had no value or use —  
save for papering walls or making darts. The discovery which shattered their society was that the  
traditional repository of purchasing power had disappeared, and that there was no means left of  
measuring the worth of anything. For many, life became an obsessional search for Sachverte,  
things of 'real', constant value: Stinnes bought his factories, mines, newspapers. The meanest  
railway worker bought gewgaws. For most, degree of necessity became the sole criterion of  
value, the basis of everything from barter to behaviour. Man's values became animal values.  
Contrary to any philosophic assumption, it was not a salutory experience.

What is precious is that which sustains life. When life is secure, society acknowledges the value  
of luxuries, those objects, materials, services or enjoyments, civilised or merely extravagant,  
without which life can proceed perfectly well but make it much pleasanter notwithstanding.  
When life is insecure, or conditions are harsh, values change. Without warmth, without a roof,  
without adequate clothes, it may be difficult to sustain life for more than a few weeks. Without  
food, life can be shorter still. At the top of the scale, the most valuable commodities are perhaps  
water and then, most precious of all, air, in whose absence life will last only a matter of minutes.  
For the destitute in Germany and Austria whose money had no exchange value left existence  
came very near these metaphysical conceptions. It had been so in the war. In All Quiet on the  
Western Front, Müller died 'and bequeathed me his boots — the same that he once inherited  
from Kemmerick. I wear them, for they fit me quite well. After me Tjaden will get them: I have  
promised them to him.'

In war, boots; in flight, a place in a boat or a seat on a lorry may be the most vital thing in the  
world, more desirable than untold millions. In hyperinflation, a kilo of potatoes was worth, to  
some, more than the family silver; a side of pork more than the grand piano. A prostitute in the  
family was better than an infant corpse; theft was preferable to starvation; warmth was finer than  
honour, clothing more essential than democracy, food more needed than freedom.
